But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem.

- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function.

- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows from parent to child components.
- **Declarative UI**: Describe what your UI should look like for a given state.

**Advanced Features:**
- **React Hooks**: Allow using state and other React features in functional components.
- **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props.
- **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server.
- **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features that help React apps stay responsive.
- **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server.
- **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components "wait" for something before rendering.', 'multiple-choice', 'beginner', 3, '[{"id":"a","text":"Component-Based Architecture, Virtual DOM, JSX, Unidirectional Data Flow, Hooks, Context API, Error Boundaries, SSR, Concurrent Mode, Suspense, Server Components","isCorrect":true},{"id":"b","text":"Two-way data binding, templates, dependency injection, directives","isCorrect":false},{"id":"c","text":"Controllers, Models, Views, Services, Filters","isCorrect":false},{"id":"d","text":"Observables, Pipes, Modules, Decorators","isCorrect":false}]', NULL, 'React''s major features include component architecture, Virtual DOM, JSX, unidirectional data flow, Hooks, Context API, Error Boundaries, SSR, Concurrent Mode, Suspense, and Server Components.', NULL, ARRAY[]::text[], ARRAY['react','features','virtual-dom','jsx','hooks','context'], '{"views":0,"attempts":0,"correct_attempts":0,"average_time":0}', '{"original_id":"react-q-003","original_type":"multiple-choice","topic":"React Basics","subcategory":"Features","sample_answers":[],"time_limit":180,"related_links":[],"created_by":"system","updated_by":"system","topic_id":"eee69693-8312-4cb1-8bf7-f2c962aae105"}', 'ca612436-af48-4e3f-a7fd-f9a9b2c52374', true, '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z', '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z');

-- Question 30: Why does React use className instead of the class attribute?
INSERT INTO questions (id, title, content, type, difficulty, points, options, correct_answer, explanation, test_cases, hints, tags, stats, metadata, category_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at) VALUES ('744d7e7b-769e-40f0-8a0c-b12a7b51935e', 'Why does React use className instead of the class attribute?', 'React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.
1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
   In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:
   ```js
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
   }
   ```
   If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.
2. JSX Is JavaScript
   When you write JSX like this:
   ```jsx
   <div class="btn">Click</div>
   ```
   It will be compiled to:
   ```jsx
   React.createElement(''div'', { class: ''btn'' }, ''Click'');
   ```
   But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.
   ```jsx
   <div className="btn">Click</div>
   ```
   which compiles to:
   ```jsx
   React.createElement(''div'', { className: ''btn'' }, ''Click'');
   ```
   React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.
3. Aligns with DOM APIs
   In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:
   ```js
   element.className = ''my-class'';
   ```
   React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API''s property name rather than HTML’s attribute.', 'multiple-choice', 'beginner', 2, '[{"id":"a","text":"Because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript","isCorrect":true},{"id":"b","text":"To make CSS harder to write","isCorrect":false},{"id":"c","text":"Because HTML doesn’t support `class`","isCorrect":false},{"id":"d","text":"It’s a typo that became standard","isCorrect":false}]', NULL, 'React uses `className` because `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript, and JSX compiles to JavaScript object literals where `class` would cause a syntax error.', NULL, ARRAY[]::text[], ARRAY['react','jsx','classname','class','dom'], '{"views":0,"attempts":0,"correct_attempts":0,"average_time":0}', '{"original_id":"react-q-030","original_type":"multiple-choice","topic":"JSX","sample_answers":[],"time_limit":120,"related_links":[],"created_by":"system","updated_by":"system","topic_id":"6a7eecc1-7cea-4bfd-84d3-e5ddff1d6624"}', 'ca612436-af48-4e3f-a7fd-f9a9b2c52374', true, '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z', '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z');

You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).
Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.
```jsx harmony
function Story({ title, description, date }) {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{date}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```
It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.
```jsx harmony
function StoryBook() {
  return stories.map((story) => (
    <Fragment key={story.id}>
      <h2>{story.title}</h2>
      <p>{story.description}</p>
      <p>{story.date}</p>
    </Fragment>
  ));
}
```
Usually, you don''t need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.
```jsx harmony
function Story({ title, description, date }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
