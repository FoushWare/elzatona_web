But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP.

**Core Features:**
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM.
- **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows from parent to child components.
- **Declarative UI**: Describe what your UI should look like for a given state.

**Advanced Features:**
- **React Hooks**: Allow using state and other React features in functional components.
- **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props.
- **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server.
- **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features that help React apps stay responsive.
- **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server.
- **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components "wait" for something before rendering.',

- A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. 
- Elements are immutable.
- Creating an element is fast and lightweight.

**Component:**
- A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements).
- Components can accept inputs (props) and manage their own state.

In summary:
- **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.

          'React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.
1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
   In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:
   ```js
   class Person {
     constructor(name) {
       this.name = name;
     }
   }
   ```
   If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.
2. JSX Is JavaScript
   When you write JSX like this:
   ```jsx
   <div class="btn">Click</div>
   ```
   It will be compiled to:
   ```jsx
   React.createElement(''div'', { class: ''btn'' }, ''Click'');
   ```
   But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.
   ```jsx
   <div className="btn">Click</div>
   ```
   which compiles to:
   ```jsx
   React.createElement(''div'', { className: ''btn'' }, ''Click'');
   ```
   React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.
3. Aligns with DOM APIs
   In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:
   ```js
   element.className = ''my-class'';
   ```
   React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API''s property name rather than HTML’s attribute.',

          'What are Fragments?',
          'It''s a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).
Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.
```jsx harmony
function Story({ title, description, date }) {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{date}</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```
It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.
```jsx harmony
function StoryBook() {
  return stories.map((story) => (
    <Fragment key={story.id}>
      <h2>{story.title}</h2>
      <p>{story.description}</p>
      <p>{story.date}</p>
    </Fragment>
  ));
}
```
Usually, you don''t need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.
```jsx harmony
function Story({ title, description, date }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>{description}</p>
      <p>{date}</p>

Bundle Splitting is a performance optimization technique that divides a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of loading one huge file containing all code (even unused code), the application loads only what’s required for the current view.

**Example:**
Splitting `main.bundle.js` into `main.bundle.js` and `emoji-picker.bundle.js` reduces initial load time by fetching less data.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Decreases loading and execution time
- Improves Time To Interactive (TTI)

**Goal:** Deliver visible and interactive content to the user faster by minimizing unnecessary code loading.',

The **PRPL Pattern** is a web performance optimization strategy that focuses on making applications load and run efficiently, even on low-end devices or slow networks.

**PRPL** stands for:
- **P**: Push critical resources for the initial route.
- **R**: Render the initial route as soon as possible.
- **P**: Pre-cache assets for future routes.
- **L**: Lazy-load remaining routes and assets.

This approach improves load times, offline experience, and caching efficiency.

**Example:** Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that use an app shell, service workers, and code-splitting to load only what’s needed.

**Pros:**
- Faster first render.
- Improved caching and offline usability.
- Reduced bandwidth usage.

**Cons:**
- Requires careful bundling and caching strategy.
- Over-pushing or preloading can waste bandwidth.',
