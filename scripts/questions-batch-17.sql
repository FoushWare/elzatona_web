          '### Bundle Splitting
Bundle Splitting is a performance optimization technique that divides a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of loading one huge file containing all code (even unused code), the application loads only what’s required for the current view.

**Example:**
Splitting `main.bundle.js` into `main.bundle.js` and `emoji-picker.bundle.js` reduces initial load time by fetching less data.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Decreases loading and execution time
- Improves Time To Interactive (TTI)

**Goal:** Deliver visible and interactive content to the user faster by minimizing unnecessary code loading.',
