# Research Notes: 008 Security Fixes Plan

## Key Findings

- Repository already contains broad in-progress edits that map to multiple planned PR phases.
- Current working branch is `fix/missing-rate-limiting`; this differs from feature branch naming in `tasks.md`.
- Existing staged/unstaged changes include security-hardening and Sonar-related refactors across apps/libs/docs.

## Implementation Implications

- Proceed with scoped, verifiable updates and task tracking.
- Avoid broad rebases or forceful branch manipulations without explicit user direction.
