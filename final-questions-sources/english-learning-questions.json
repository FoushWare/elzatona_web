      "explanation": "**Code Review Vocabulary:**\n\n**1. Positive Feedback:**\n\n// Appreciation and recognition\n'Great work on this implementation!';\n'Excellent solution to this complex problem.';\n'Nice refactoring - the code is much cleaner now.';\n'Good catch on that edge case.';\n'Perfect! This is exactly what we needed.';\n\n// Specific technical praise\n'Smart use of the observer pattern here.';\n'Excellent performance optimization.';\n'Great job following the established patterns.';\n'Nice separation of concerns.';\n'Good error handling implementation.';\n\n// Learning and improvement\n'This is a great learning opportunity for the team.';\n'Thanks for sharing this approach - I learned something new.';\n'Good documentation - this will help future developers.';\n\n**2. Constructive Criticism:**\n\n// Suggesting improvements\n'I think we could improve this by...';\n'Have you considered using...?';\n'An alternative approach might be...';\n'What do you think about...?';\n'Could we make this more maintainable by...?';\n\n// Performance concerns\n'This might cause performance issues with large datasets.';\n'Consider the memory implications of this approach.';\n'We should be mindful of the time complexity here.';\n'This could be optimized further by...';\n\n// Code quality\n'The code would be more readable if...';\n'Consider extracting this into a separate function.';\n'This logic could be simplified by...';\n'We might want to add some error handling here.';\n\n**3. Questions and Clarifications:**\n\n// Understanding the code\n'Could you explain the reasoning behind this approach?';\n\"I'm not sure I understand this part - could you clarify?\";\n'What happens in this edge case?';\n'How does this interact with the existing system?';\n'Is this the intended behavior?';\n\n// Technical questions\n'Have you tested this with...?';\n\"What's the expected performance of this solution?\";\n'Are there any security considerations here?';\n'How does this handle concurrent access?';\n\"What's the fallback strategy if this fails?\";\n\n**4. Common Review Patterns:**\n\n// Code review template\n/**\n* Overall Assessment:\n* The implementation looks good overall. I have a few suggestions for improvement.\n*\n* Strengths:\n* - Clean, readable code\n* - Good error handling\n* - Proper testing coverage\n*\n* Areas for Improvement:\n* - Consider performance implications\n* - Add more comprehensive error handling\n* - Improve code documentation\n*\n* Specific Comments:\n* - Line 45: Consider using a more descriptive variable name\n* - Line 78: This could be extracted into a utility function\n* - Line 102: Add input validation here\n*\n* Questions:\n* - How does this handle edge cases?\n* - Have you considered the memory usage?\n* - What's the expected behavior when the API is down?\n*/\n\n**5. Action Items:**\n\n// Requesting changes\n'Please address the following before merging:';\n'Could you fix these issues:';\n\"Let's discuss these points:\";\n\"I'd like to see these changes:\";\n\n// Prioritizing feedback\n'High priority:';\n'Medium priority:';\n'Low priority / Nice to have:';\n'Optional improvement:';\n\n// Follow-up actions\n\"Once you've made these changes, I'll take another look.\";\n\"Let me know when you're ready for another review.\";\n'Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.';\n'Great work! Ready to merge once the tests pass.';",
