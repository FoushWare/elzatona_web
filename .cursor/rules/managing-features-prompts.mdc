# Cursor Rules for Project Ideas

## Rules for Managing Features & Prompts

1. **Ideas Directory**
   - Every new **feature** or **prompt** must have its own dedicated markdown file.
   - Files should be stored inside the `ideas/` directory.

2. **File Naming Convention**
   - Use lowercase, kebab-case for filenames.
   - Example:
     - `dual-entry-feature.md`
     - `improve-onboarding-prompt.md`

3. **File Structure**
   Each markdown file should include:
   - **Title**: Name of the feature or prompt.
   - **Description**: Short explanation of what it is and why it’s needed.
   - **Details**: Expanded notes, design ideas, or implementation notes.
   - **E2E Testing**: How to test the feature end-to-end.
   - **Status**: (draft | in-progress | implemented)

   Example:

   ```markdown
   # Dual Entry Feature

   **Description**  
   Add support for dual entry logic in forms to ensure accuracy.

   **Details**

   - Compare field A with field B before submission.
   - Show inline validation messages.
   - Use case: KYC and financial forms.

   **E2E Testing**

   - Navigate to the form page.
   - Fill in both fields with different values → expect error message.
   - Fill in both fields with the same value → expect successful submission.
   - Run `npm run test:e2e` and check Cypress/Playwright logs.

   **Status**  
   Draft
   ```
