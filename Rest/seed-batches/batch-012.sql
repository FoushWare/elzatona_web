You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.

     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.


     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.',

The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component''s functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.

     Let''s take an example of `<FilterLink>` component using connect:


     Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using `connect()` over accessing the store directly (using context API).',

Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a `ReferenceError` immediately.

     Normally we will save them in a single file (`constants.js` or `actionTypes.js`).


     In Redux, you use them in two places:

     1. **During action creation:**

        Let''s take `actions.js`:
