It''s a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
    You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).

    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.


    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.


    Usually, you don''t need to use `<Fragment>` until there is a need of _key_ attribute. The usage of shorter syntax looks like below.',

A Portal is a React feature that enables rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component''s DOM hierarchy, while still preserving the React component hierarchy. Portals help avoid CSS stacking issues—for example, elements with position: fixed may not behave as expected inside a parent with transform. Portals solve this by rendering content (like modals or tooltips) outside such constrained DOM contexts.

    *   `child`: Any valid React node (e.g., JSX, string, fragment).
    *   `container`: A real DOM node (e.g., `document.getElementById(''modal-root'')`).

    Even though the content renders elsewhere in the DOM, it still behaves like a normal child in React. It has access to context, state, and event handling.

    **Example:- Modal:**
    The above code will render the modal content into the body element in the HTML, not inside the component''s usual location.',

When the application is running in _development mode_, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have _correct type_. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It''s disabled in _production mode_ due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with `isRequired`.

    The set of predefined prop types:

    1. `PropTypes.number`
    2. `PropTypes.string`
    3. `PropTypes.array`
    4. `PropTypes.object`
    5. `PropTypes.func`
    6. `PropTypes.node`
    7. `PropTypes.element`
    8. `PropTypes.bool`
    9. `PropTypes.symbol`
    10. `PropTypes.any`

    We can define `propTypes` for `User` component as below:


    **Note:** In React v15.5 _PropTypes_ were moved from `React.PropTypes` to `prop-types` library.
