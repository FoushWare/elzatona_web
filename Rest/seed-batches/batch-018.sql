The _defaultProps_ can be defined as a property on the component to set the default values for the props.

The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component.

     For example, To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a withSubscription HOC.',

Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack and Browserify which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. The react project supports code splitting via dynamic import() feature.

     For example, in the below code snippets, it will make moduleA.js and all its unique dependencies as a separate chunk that only loads after the user clicks the ''Load'' button.

     **moduleA.js**


     **App.js**
