Bundle Splitting is a performance optimization technique that divides a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of loading one huge file containing all code (even unused code), the application loads only what’s required for the current view.

**Example:**
Splitting <code>main.bundle.js</code> into <code>main.bundle.js</code> and <code>emoji-picker.bundle.js</code> reduces initial load time by fetching less data.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Decreases loading and execution time
- Improves Time To Interactive (TTI)

**Goal:** Deliver visible and interactive content to the user faster by minimizing unnecessary code loading.',

Dynamic imports allow us to load JavaScript modules only when needed rather than at initial load. This enables bundle splitting by creating separate chunks for on-demand code.

  render(&lt;EmojiPicker /&gt;);
});</code></pre>
