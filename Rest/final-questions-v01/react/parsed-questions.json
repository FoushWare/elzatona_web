    "explanation": "React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an **open-source front-end JavaScript library** for building user interfaces based on components. It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.\n\n    React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. The library was open-sourced in May 2013 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces."

    "explanation": "The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.\n\n       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.\n\n       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.\n\n           The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:\n    \n       **2010-2011: The Origins**\n       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code\n       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes\n\n       **2011-2012: Early Development**\n       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP's component model\n       - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with performance improvements\n       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders\n       - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012\n\n       **2013: Public Release**\n       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013\n       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript\n\n       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**\n       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app development\n       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management\n       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications\n\n       **2016-2018: Maturation**\n       - React 16 (\"Fiber\") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture\n       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering\n       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management\n\n       **2019-Present: Modern React**\n       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components\n       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier\n       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching\n       - React continues to evolve with Server Components, the new React compiler (React Forget), and other performance improvements\n\n       **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach of embedding XML-like syntax in code."

    "explanation": "React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:\n\n    **Core Features:**\n\n    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.\n\n    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.\n\n    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.\n\n    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.\n\n    **Advanced Features:**\n\n    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.\n\n    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.\n\n    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.\n\n    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.\n\n    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed.\n\n    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.\n\n    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components \"wait\" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.\n\n    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications."

    "explanation": "**Element:**\n      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. \n      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.\n      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.\n      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.\n\n        **Example (without JSX):**\n\n        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**\n\n        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**\n        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.\n\n\n      **Component:**\n      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).\n      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.\n      - You can define a component using a function or a class:\n\n        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**\n\n        When JSX is compiled, it's transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:\n\n\n\n      **In summary:**\n      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.\n      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.\n\n       > Think of **elements** as the instructions for creating UI, and **components** as reusable blueprints that combine logic and structure to generate those instructions."

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.\n\n    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.\n\n    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.\n    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.\n\n    So the summary to this question is as follows:\n\n    **Use Function Components:**\n\n    - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.\n    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.\n\n    **Use Class Components:**\n\n    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.\n    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.\n\n    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.\n\n    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.\n\n    > **_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component.

    "explanation": "Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.\n\n    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.\n\n    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,\n\n\n    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).\n\n\n    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.\n\n    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.\n\n    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component."

It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified.

    "explanation": "In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:\n\n    ### State\n    - **Definition:**  \n      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).\n    - **Scope:**  \n      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.\n    - **Usage:**  \n      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.\n    - **Re-rendering:**  \n      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.\n\n    ### Props\n    - **Definition:**  \n      Props (short for “properties”) are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      Props are read-only. A component cannot modify its own props; they are immutable from the component’s perspective.\n    - **Scope:**  \n      Props are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree, enabling parent components to configure or communicate with their children.\n    - **Usage:**  \n      Props are commonly used to make components reusable and configurable. They allow the same component to be rendered with different data or behavior.\n    - **Analogy:**  \n      Think of props as arguments to a function, whereas state is like variables declared inside the function.\n\n    ### Summary Table\n\n    | Feature   | State                               | Props                             |\n    |-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n    | Managed by| The component itself                | Parent component                  |\n    | Mutable   | Yes                                 | No (read-only)                    |\n    | Scope     | Local to the component              | Passed from parent to child       |\n    | Usage     | Manage dynamic data and UI changes  | Configure and customize component |\n    | Update    | Using setState/useState             | Cannot be updated by the component|"

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "The _Virtual DOM_ works in five simple steps.\n\n    **1. Initial Render**  \n        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.\n\n    **2. State or Props Change**  \n        When the component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn't immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.\n               \n      ![vdom](images/vdom1.png)\n\n    **3. Diffing Algorithm**  \n        React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. It determines what has changed between the two versions and identifies the minimal set of updates needed.\n       \n       ![vdom2](images/vdom2.png)  \n\n    **4. Reconciliation**  \n        Based on the diffing results, React decides which parts of the Real DOM should be updated. It avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and instead updates only the elements that actually changed.\n        \n       ![vdom3](images/vdom3.png)\n\n    **5. Efficient DOM Updates**  \n        This entire process—working with the Virtual DOM, diffing, and selective updating—makes the UI rendering much faster and more efficient than manipulating the Real DOM directly."

The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.\n\n    Let's take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.\n\n    **withAuth HOC Example:**\n    **Usage**\n\n    HOC can be used for many use cases:\n\n    1.

    "explanation": "Yes, you can use `async/await` in plain React, as long as your JavaScript environment supports ES2017+. Nowadays most modern browsers and build tools support ES2017+ version. If you're using **Create React App**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, or any modern React setup, `async/await` is supported out of the box through **Babel**.\n\n    ### Example Usage\n\n    But If you're not using a bundler like **Webpack or Babel**, you will need _Babel_ and [transform-async-to-generator](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator) plugin. However, React Native ships with Babel and a set of transforms."

The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.\n   \n     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state."

    "code": null,

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:\n\n     1.  **Immutability is essential**  \n        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux’s more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.\n     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  \n        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.\n     3.  **Limited static type integration**  \n        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux’s type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases."

    "explanation": "These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but there are some vague similarities.\n\n     Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern."

This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.\n\n     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components.

    "explanation": "When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,\n\n     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**\n        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.\n     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,\n\n\n     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**\n        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.\n     4. **Recursing On Children:**\n        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.\n\n\n     5. **Handling keys:**\n        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,"

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "React Portals are primarily used to render UI components such as **modals, tooltips, dropdowns, hovercards, and notifications** outside of their parent component's DOM tree. This helps avoid common CSS issues caused by parent elements, such as:\n\n     *   `**overflow: hidden**` on parent elements clipping or hiding child elements like modals or tooltips,\n     *   **stacking context and** `**z-index**` **conflicts** created by parent containers that prevent child elements from appearing above other content.\n\n     That means, you need to visually “break out” of its container. By rendering these UI elements into a separate DOM node (often directly under `<body>`), portals ensure they appear above all other content and are not restricted by the parent’s CSS or layout constraints, resulting in correct positioning and visibility regardless of the parent’s styling."

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\n     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\n     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect."

    "explanation": "There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,\n\n     ## 1. Syntax:\n\n     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.\n\n     The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n\n\n     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.\n\n     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.\n\n\n     ## 2. State:\n\n     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.\n\n     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n\n     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**\n\n\n     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.\n\n     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.\n\n     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,\n\n\n     ## 3. Props:\n\n     Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.\n\n     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,\n\n\n     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword."

For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.\n\n\n        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.\n\n     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.\n\n     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders."

The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.\n\n\n      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won't be update upon entering the input fields.\n      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.\n\n\n      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field.

In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value.

Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.\n\n      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.\n\n\n      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo."

    "explanation": "There are two guidelines to be taken care while writing reducers in your code.\n\n     1. Reducers must be pure without mutating the state. That means, same input always returns the same output. These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.\n\n     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction even though there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you \"reset\" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one \"reset\" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose."

    "section": "Miscellaneous",

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here's an overview of how it works internally:\n\n     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**\n\n     React doesn't manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.\n\n     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):\n\n        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).\n        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.\n        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.\n        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.\n\n     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.\n\n     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**\n\n     React’s core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:\n\n        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).\n        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).\n        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.\n\n     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:\n\n        *   The component type (function/class).\n        *   Props, state, and effects.\n        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.\n\n     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**\n\n     When state or props change:\n\n        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.\n        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.\n        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.\n\n     This process is known as **reconciliation**.\n\n     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**\n\n     Once reconciliation is done:\n\n        *   React enters the **commit phase**.\n        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.\n        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.\n\n     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.\n\n     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**\n\n     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):\n\n        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.\n        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.\n        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.\n\n     #### 6. **React Scheduler**\n\n     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:\n\n        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.\n        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.\n        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode."

Here are some common and effective use cases:\n\n        1.  **Theme Customization**  \n            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.\n        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  \n            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.\n        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  \n            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.\n        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  \n            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.\n        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  \n            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic.

    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "An **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.\n     \n     The updater function expression looks like below,\n     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.\n\n     In the React community, there's often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or \"stale\" state.\n\n     While using an updater function is a good habit, it's not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.\n     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.\n\n     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**\n\n     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.\n\n     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:"

It is conceptually similar to **Redux**. i.e, Instead of directly updating state like with `useState`, you **dispatch an action** to a **reducer function**, and the reducer returns the new state.\n\n     The `useReducer` hook takes three arguments:\n\n\n        *   `**reducer**`: A function `(state, action) => newState` that handles how state should change based on the action.\n        *   `**initialState**`: The starting state.\n        *   `**dispatch**`: A function you call to trigger an update by passing an action.\n\n     The `useReducer` hook is used when:\n\n     *   The **state is complex**, such as nested structures or multiple related values.\n     *   State updates depend on the **previous state** and **logic**.\n     *   You want to **separate state update logic** from UI code to make it cleaner and testable.\n     *   You’re managing features like:\n         *   Forms\n         *   Wizards / Multi-step flows\n         *   Undo/Redo functionality\n         *   Shopping cart logic\n         *   Toggle & conditional UI logic"

Split Contexts**  \n     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:\n\n\n     **2.

    "explanation": "The `useMemo` hook **does not directly prevent re-rendering of child components**. Its main purpose is to memoize the result of an expensive computation so that it doesn’t get recalculated unless its dependencies change. While this can improve performance, it doesn’t inherently control whether a child component re-renders.\n        \n        However, `useMemo` **can help prevent re-renders** when the memoized value is passed as a prop to a child component that is wrapped in `React.memo`. In that case, if the memoized value doesn’t change between renders (i.e., it has the same reference), React.memo can skip re-rendering the child. So, while `useMemo` doesn’t stop renders on its own, it **works in combination** with tools like `React.memo` to optimize rendering behavior."

The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.\n\n\n      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.\n\n      **Example: AuthorList component**\n     \n      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:\n       *   Promotes **code reuse**\n       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**\n       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**"

    "options": null,
    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "React Fiber is the **core engine** that enables advanced features like **concurrent rendering**, **prioritization**, and **interruptibility** in React. Here's how it works:\n          \n      ### 1. **Fiber Tree Structure**\n          \n      Each component in your app is represented by a **Fiber node** in a tree structure. A Fiber node contains:\n      *   Component type\n      *   Props & state\n      *   Pointers to parent, child, and sibling nodes\n      *   Effect tags to track changes (e.g., update, placement)\n      *   This forms the **Fiber Tree**, a data structure React uses instead of the traditional call stack.\n          \n      ### 2. **Two Phases of Rendering**\n          \n        #### **A. Render Phase (work-in-progress)**\n          \n      *   React builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**.\n      *   It walks through each component (begin phase), calculates what needs to change, and collects side effects (complete phase).\n      *   This phase is **interruptible**—React can pause it and resume later.\n        #### **B. Commit Phase**\n          \n      *   React applies changes to the **Real DOM**.\n      *   Runs lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`).\n      *   This phase is **non-interruptible** but fast.\n          \n        ### 3. **Work Units and Scheduling**\n          \n      *   React breaks rendering into **units of work** (small tasks).\n      *   These units are scheduled based on **priority** using the **React Scheduler**.\n      *   If time runs out (e.g., user starts typing), React can **pause and yield** control back to the browser.\n          \n        ### 4. **Double Buffering with Two Trees**\n          \n      *   React maintains two trees:\n      *   **Current Tree** – what's visible on the screen.\n      *   **Work-In-Progress Tree** – the next version being built in memory.\n      *   Only after the new tree is fully ready, React **commits** it, making it the new current tree.\n          \n        ### 5. **Concurrency and Prioritization**\n          \n      *   React can prepare multiple versions of UI at once (e.g., during slow data loading).\n      *   Updates can be **assigned priorities**, so urgent updates (like clicks) are handled faster than background work."

    "explanation": "The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.\n\n    #### Example\n\n\n    #### When to use the callback?\n\n    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.\n\n    #### Note\n\n    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.\n    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.\n    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change."

They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n   3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different).

This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n    4. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n    5. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n\n    6. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n\n    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\n    ![phases 16.4+](images/phases16.4.png)\n\n    Before React 16.3\n\n    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)"

    "options": null,
    "correctAnswer": null,
    "explanation": "The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n\n    **(OR)**\n\n    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?\n\n    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n    This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n\n    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument."

Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\n    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting."
