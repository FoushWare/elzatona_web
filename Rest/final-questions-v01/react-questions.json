React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after <code>setState()</code> is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling <code>setState()</code> since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to <code>setState()</code>, with the previous state as an argument.
