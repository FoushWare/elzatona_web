      'Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized <code>React.memo()</code> API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.',
