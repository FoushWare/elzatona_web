Apart from these approaches, you can also embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces and then followed by JS logical operator <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. It is helpful to render elements conditionally within a single line and commonly used for concise logic, especially in JSX rendering.",
