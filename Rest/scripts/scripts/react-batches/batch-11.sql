```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

export default sum;

Create a file named `sum.test.js` which contains actual test:

```javascript
import sum from "./sum";

test("adds 1 + 2 to equal 3", () => {
  expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
});
```

And then add the following section to your `package.json`:

```json

    "test": "jest"
  }
}
