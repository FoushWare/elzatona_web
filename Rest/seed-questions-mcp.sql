<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

<code>In</code> JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable c holds a value to an <code>object</code>. Later, we assign d with the same reference that c has to the <code>object</code>.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ko5k0fs.png" width="200">

When you change one <code>object</code>, you change all <code>of</code> them.

- <code>In</code> **Browsers** such <code>as</code> _Chrome_, name is a _deprecated <code>global</code> scope property_. <code>In</code> <code>this</code> example, the code is running inside _global scope_ and there is no user-defined local variable <code>for</code> name, therefore it searches the predefined _variables/properties_ <code>in</code> the <code>global</code> scope which is <code>in</code> the casede>ase <code>of</code> browsers, it searches through windowindowindow <code>object</code> and it will extract the [windowindow.name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Windowindow/name) value which is equal to an **empty stringde>ing**.

- <code>In</code> **NodeJS**, there is no such property on the globallobal <code>object</code>, thus attempting to access a non-existent variable will raise a [<code>ReferenceError</code>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Not_defined).',

#### Answer: A

A pure <code>function</code> is a <code>function</code> that _always_ returns the same result, <code>if</code> the same arguments are passed.

The sum <code>function</code> always returns the same result. <code>If</code> we pass 1 and 2, it will _always_ <code>return</code> 3 without side effects. <code>If</code> we pass 5 and 10, it will _always_ <code>return</code> 15, and so on. <code>This</code> is the definition <code>of</code> a pure <code>function</code>.

Then we call the myPromiseomise <code>promise</code>, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. Pay attention, that now only the first then clause was added to the microtask queue.

Both the <code>promise</code> and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the <code>function</code> keeps on running <code>while</code> it''s busy completing the <code>promise</code> and handling the setTimeoutmeout callback. <code>This</code> means that Last line 1!ne 1! gets logged first, since <code>this</code> is not an asynchonous operation. 

Since the callstack is not empty yet, the setTimeoutmeout <code>function</code> and <code>promise</code> <code>in</code> funcOne cannot get added to the callstack yet.

<code>In</code> funcTwo, the variable res gets Promiseomise because <code>Promise</code>.resolve(<code>Promise</code>.resolve(''<code>Promise</code>''))ode><code>Promise</code>.resolve(''<code>Promise</code>'')) is equivalent to <code>Promise</code>.resolve(''<code>Promise</code>'')resolve(''<code>Promise</code>'') since resolving a <code>promise</code> just resolves it''s value. The awaitawait <code>in</code> <code>this</code> line stops the execution <code>of</code> the <code>function</code> until it receives the resolution <code>of</code> the <code>promise</code> and then keeps on running synchronously until completion, so <code>Promise</code> 2!se 2! and then Last line 2!ne 2! are logged and the setTimeoutmeout is sent to the Web API. <code>If</code> the first then clause <code>in</code> funcOne had its own log statement, it would be printed before <code>Promise</code> 2!se 2!. Howewer, it executed silently and put the second then clause <code>in</code> microtask queue. So, the second clause will be printed after <code>Promise</code> 2!se 2!.

Then the call stack is empty. Promises are _microtasks_ so they are resolved first when the call stack is empty so <code>Promise</code> 1!se 1! gets to be logged.

Now, since funcTwo popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting <code>in</code> the queue (() =&gt; <code>console</code>.log("Timeout 1!").loge>.log("Timeout 1!") <code>from</code> funcOne, and () =&gt; <code>console</code>.log("Timeout 2!").loge>.log("Timeout 2!") <code>from</code> funcTwo) get added to the call stack one by one.

      '### Bundle Splitting
Bundle Splitting is a performance optimization technique that divides a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of loading one huge file containing all code (even unused code), the application loads only what’s required for the current view.

**Example:**
Splitting <code>main.bundle.js</code> into <code>main.bundle.js</code> and <code>emoji-picker.bundle.js</code> reduces initial load time by fetching less data.

**Why it matters:**
- Reduces time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Decreases loading and execution time
- Improves Time To Interactive (TTI)

**Goal:** Deliver visible and interactive content to the user faster by minimizing unnecessary code loading.',

      '### PRPL Pattern
The **PRPL Pattern** is a web performance optimization strategy that focuses on making applications load and run efficiently, even on low-end devices or slow networks.

**PRPL** stands for:
- **P**: Push critical resources for the initial route.
- **R**: Render the initial route as soon as possible.
- **P**: Pre-cache assets for future routes.
- **L**: Lazy-load remaining routes and assets.

This approach improves load times, offline experience, and caching efficiency.

**Example:** Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that use an app shell, service workers, and code-splitting to load only what’s needed.

**Pros:**
- Faster first render.
- Improved caching and offline usability.
- Reduced bandwidth usage.

**Cons:**
- Requires careful bundling and caching strategy.
- Over-pushing or preloading can waste bandwidth.',

       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.

       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.

           The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:
    
       **2010-2011: The Origins**
       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code
       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes

       **2011-2012: Early Development**
       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP''s component model
       - The key innovation was bringing XHP''s component model to JavaScript with performance improvements
       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders
       - First deployed internally on Facebook''s News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012

       **2013: Public Release**
       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013
       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript

       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**
       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React''s paradigm to mobile app development
       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management
       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications

       **2016-2018: Maturation**
       - React 16 ("Fiber") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture
       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering
       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management

       **2019-Present: Modern React**
       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components
       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier
       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching

      'React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:

    **Core Features:**

    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.

    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.

    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.

    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.

    **Advanced Features:**

    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.

    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.

    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.

    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.

    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user''s device capabilities and network speed.

    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.

    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components "wait" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.

    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications.',

**Element:**
      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. 
      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.
      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.
      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.

        **Example (without JSX):**

        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**

        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**
        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.


      **Component:**
      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).
      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.
      - You can define a component using a function or a class:

        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**

        When JSX is compiled, it''s transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:



      **In summary:**
      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.
      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.

      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.
      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.

        **Example (without JSX):**

        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**

        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**
        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.


      **Component:**
      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).
      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.
      - You can define a component using a function or a class:

        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**

        When JSX is compiled, it''s transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:



      **In summary:**
      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.
      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI.

Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.

    1. **Function Components:** This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the one and only one parameter and return React elements to render the output:

After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.

    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.

    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.
    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.

    So the summary to this question is as follows:

    **Use Function Components:**

    - If you don''t need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.
    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.

    **Use Class Components:**

    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.
    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.

    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.

    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward.

Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.

    But at the same time, it won''t compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.

    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,


    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).


    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won''t be any re-renders for email prop change.

    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.

_State_ of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

    ![state](images/state.jpg)

    Let''s take an example of **User** component with `message` state. Here, **useState** hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.


    Whenever React calls your component or access `useState` hook, it gives you a snapshot of the state for that particular render.

_Props_ are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation similar to HTML-tag attributes. Here, the data is passed down from a parent component to a child component.

    The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

    1. Pass custom data to your component.
    2. Trigger state changes.
    3. Use via `this.props.reactProp` inside component''s `render()` method.

    For example, let us create an element with `reactProp` property:


    This `reactProp` (or whatever you came up with) attribute name then becomes a property attached to React''s native props object which originally already exists on all components created using React library.


    For example, the usage of props in function component looks like below:


The properties from props object can be accessed directly using destructing feature from ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is also possible to fallback to default value when the prop value is not specified. The above child component can be simplified like below.


**Note:** The default value won''t be used if you pass `null` or `0` value. i.e, default value is only used if the prop value is missed or `undefined` value has been passed.

      'In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:

    ### State
    - **Definition:**  
      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.
    - **Mutability:**  
      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).
    - **Scope:**  
      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.
    - **Usage:**  
      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.
    - **Re-rendering:**  
      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.

    ### Props
    - **Definition:**  
      Props (short for “properties”) are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.
    - **Mutability:**  
      Props are read-only. A component cannot modify its own props; they are immutable from the component’s perspective.
    - **Scope:**  
      Props are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree, enabling parent components to configure or communicate with their children.
    - **Usage:**  
      Props are commonly used to make components reusable and configurable. They allow the same component to be rendered with different data or behavior.
    - **Analogy:**  
      Think of props as arguments to a function, whereas state is like variables declared inside the function.

Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,

    1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:


       Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:


    2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:


       Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:


    3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`
       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name. (refer "activateLasers" function in the first point for example)',

`SyntheticEvent` is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser''s native event. Its API is same as the browser''s native event, including `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`, except the events work identically across all browsers. The native events can be accessed directly from synthetic events using `nativeEvent` attribute.

    Let''s take an example of `BookStore` title search component with the ability to get all native event properties

    
    List of common synthetic events are:

    *   `onClick`
    *   `onChange`
    *   `onSubmit`
    *   `onKeyDown`, `onKeyUp`

A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:


    When you don''t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:

    **Benefits of key:**
      *   Enables React to **efficiently update and re-render** components.
      *   Prevents unnecessary re-renders by **reusing** components when possible.
      *   Helps **maintain internal state** of list items correctly.

    **Note:**

    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.
    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.
    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.
    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.
    5. Don''t generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`. Because the keys will never match up between re-renders and DOM created everytime.',

    **1. Initial Render**  
        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.

    **2. State or Props Change**  
        When the component''s state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn''t immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.

    **3. Diffing Algorithm**

A **controlled component** is a React component that **fully manages the form element''s state**(e.g, elements like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`))  using React''s internal state mechanism. i.e, The component does not manage its own internal state — instead, React acts as the single source of truth for form data.

    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.
    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.
    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`''s updater function or `setState` from class component.
    4. Attach the above event handler to form element''s change or click events

    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.

   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,

   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.
   
   **Benefits:**

   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.
   *   Full control over form data.
   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component’s state.',

    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.
    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.
    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`''s updater function or `setState` from class component.
    4. Attach the above event handler to form element''s change or click events

    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.

   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,

   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.
   
   **Benefits:**

   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.
   *   Full control over form data.
   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component’s state.',

The **Uncontrolled components** are form elements (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) that **manage their own state internally** via the **DOM**, rather than through React state.
    You can query the DOM using a `ref` to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.

    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,

    1. Create a ref using `useRef` react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in class based component.
    2. Attach this `ref` to the form element.
    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components

    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.

    **Note:** Here, DOM is in charge of the value. React only accesses the value when needed (via `ref`).

    **Benefits:**
     *   **Less boilerplate** — no need for `useState` and `onChange`.
     *   Useful for **quick form setups** or when integrating with **non-React code**.
     *   Slightly better **performance** in very large forms (fewer re-renders).

    In most cases, it''s recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props, behavior, or data. It’s a design pattern based on React’s compositional nature, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying their internals.

    We consider HOCs **pure components** because they don’t mutate or copy behavior from the original component—they simply **wrap it**, enhance it, and pass through the necessary props. The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.

    Let''s take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.

    **withAuth HOC Example:**
    **Usage**

    HOC can be used for many use cases:

    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction (e.g., fetching data, permissions, theming).
    2. Render hijacking (e.g., conditional rendering or layout changes).
    3. State abstraction and manipulation(e.g., handling form logic).
    4. Props manipulation(e.g., injecting additional props or filtering them).
    
    Some of the real-world examples of HOCs in react eco-system:
    1. connect() from react-redux
    2. withRouter() from React Router v5

React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.

    1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript
        In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:
      
        If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.

    2. JSX Is JavaScript
    
        When you write JSX like this:
        It will be compiled to:
        But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.
        which compiles to:
        React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.

It''s a common pattern or practice in React for a component to return multiple elements. _Fragments_ let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
    You need to use either `<Fragment>` or a shorter syntax having empty tag (`<></>`).

    Below is the example of how to use fragment inside _Story_ component.


    It is also possible to render list of fragments inside a loop with the mandatory **key** attribute supplied.

A Portal is a React feature that enables rendering children into a DOM node that exists outside the parent component''s DOM hierarchy, while still preserving the React component hierarchy. Portals help avoid CSS stacking issues—for example, elements with position: fixed may not behave as expected inside a parent with transform. Portals solve this by rendering content (like modals or tooltips) outside such constrained DOM contexts.

    *   `child`: Any valid React node (e.g., JSX, string, fragment).
    *   `container`: A real DOM node (e.g., `document.getElementById(''modal-root'')`).

    Even though the content renders elsewhere in the DOM, it still behaves like a normal child in React. It has access to context, state, and event handling.

When the application is running in _development mode_, React will automatically check all props that we set on components to make sure they have _correct type_. If the type is incorrect, React will generate warning messages in the console. It''s disabled in _production mode_ due to performance impact. The mandatory props are defined with `isRequired`.

    1. `PropTypes.number`
    2. `PropTypes.string`

    7. `PropTypes.element`
    8. `PropTypes.bool`

Yes, you can use `async/await` in plain React, as long as your JavaScript environment supports ES2017+. Nowadays most modern browsers and build tools support ES2017+ version. If you''re using **Create React App**, **Next.js**, **Remix**, or any modern React setup, `async/await` is supported out of the box through **Babel**.

There are three different ways to achieve programmatic routing/navigation within components.

    1.  **Using the `withRouter()` higher-order function:**

    2.  **Using `<Route>` component and render props pattern:**

      '**Flux** is an **application architecture** (not a framework or library) designed by Facebook to manage **data flow** in React applications. It was created as an alternative to the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, and it emphasizes a **unidirectional data flow** to make state changes more predictable and easier to debug.

       Flux complements React by organizing the way data moves through your application, especially in large-scale or complex projects.

       #### Core Concepts of Flux

       Flux operates using **four key components**, each with a specific responsibility:
       *   **Actions**
             *   Plain JavaScript objects or functions that describe _what happened_ (e.g., user interactions or API responses).
             *   Example: `{ type: ''ADD_TODO'', payload: ''Buy milk'' }`
       *   **Dispatcher**
             *   A central hub that receives actions and **dispatches** them to the appropriate stores.
             *   There is **only one dispatcher** in a Flux application.
       *   **Stores**
             *   Hold the **application state** and business logic.
             *   Respond to actions from the dispatcher and update themselves accordingly.
             *   They **emit change events** that views can listen to.
       *   **Views (React Components)**
             *   Subscribe to stores and **re-render** when the data changes.
             *   They can also trigger new actions (e.g., on user input).


       The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:

Redux follows three fundamental principles:

     1. **Single source of truth:** The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
   
     2. **State is read-only:** The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.',

      'While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:

     1.  **Immutability is essential**  
        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux’s more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.
     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  
        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.
     3.  **Limited static type integration**  
        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux’s type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.',

You need to write a _root reducer_ in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by `combineReducers()`.

     For example, let us take `rootReducer()` to return the initial state after `USER_LOGOUT` action. As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with `undefined` as the first argument, no matter the action.


     In case of using `redux-persist`, you may also need to clean your storage. `redux-persist` keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.',

The best way to access your store in a component is to use the `connect()` function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called _Higher-Order Components_, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component''s functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.

     | React is a library and has only the View layer                                              | Angular is a framework and has complete MVC functionality                                                                          |
     | React handles rendering on the server side                                                  | AngularJS renders only on the client side but Angular 2 and above renders on the server side                                       |
     | React uses JSX that looks like HTML in JS which can be confusing                            | Angular follows the template approach for HTML, which makes code shorter and easy to understand                                    |
     | React Native, which is a React type to build mobile applications are faster and more stable | Ionic, Angular''s mobile native app is relatively less stable and slower                                                            |
     | In React, data flows only in one way and hence debugging is easy                            | In Angular, data flows both way i.e it has two-way data binding between children and parent and hence debugging is often difficult |

Let''s see the main features of Reselect library,

     1. Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
     2. Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
     3. Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.

You need to follow two rules in order to use hooks,

     1. **Call Hooks only at the top level of your react functions:** You should always use hooks at the top level of react function before any early returns. i.e, You shouldn’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to `useState` and `useEffect` calls.

     Let''s see the difference using an example,
     **Correct usage:**:
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     The `useState` hook for the country field is being called conditionally within an `if` block. This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.

     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.

     Let''s find the difference of correct and incorrect usage with below examples,

     **Correct usage:**:
     **Incorrect usage:**:
     In the above incorrect usage example, both `useState` and `useEffect` are used in non-React functions(`normalFunction` and `fetchData`), which is not allowed.',

React Suspense is a built-in feature that lets you defer rendering part of your component tree until some condition(asynchronous operation) is met—usually, data or code has finished loading. While waiting, Suspense lets you display a fallback UI like a spinner or placeholder.


     1. Lazy loading components uses suspense feature,


        If the module containing the dynamic import is not yet loaded by the time parent component renders, you must show some fallback content while you’re waiting for it to load using a loading indicator. This can be done using **Suspense** component.
    
        The above component shows fallback UI instead real component until `OtherComponent` is fully loaded.

When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. It covers the below rules during reconciliation algorithm,

     1. **Elements Of Different Types:**
        Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. For example, elements <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment> of different types lead a full rebuild.
     2. **DOM Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. Lets take an example with same DOM elements except className attribute,


     3. **Component Elements Of The Same Type:**
        When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls componentWillReceiveProps() and componentWillUpdate() on the underlying instance. After that, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.
     4. **Recursing On Children:**
        when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well.


     5. **Handling keys:**
        React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key can make the tree conversion efficient,',

Bootstrap can be added to your React app in a three possible ways,

     1. Using the Bootstrap CDN:
        This is the easiest way to add bootstrap. Add both bootstrap CSS and JS resources in a head tag.
     2. Bootstrap as Dependency:
        If you are using a build tool or a module bundler such as Webpack, then this is the preferred option for adding Bootstrap to your React application
     3. React Bootstrap Package:
        In this case, you can add Bootstrap to our React app is by using a package that has rebuilt Bootstrap components to work particularly as React components. Below packages are popular in this category,

The `useEffect` hook is a React Hook that lets you perform **side effects** in function components. Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or system and aren''t directly related to rendering UI — such as fetching data, setting up subscriptions, timers, manually manipulating the DOM, etc.

     In function components, useEffect replaces the class component lifecycle methods(`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount`) with a single, unified API.     

     **Syntax**
     This effect hook can be used to fetch data from an API and to set the data in the local state of the component with the useState hook’s update function.

     Here is an example of fetching a list of ReactJS articles from an API using fetch.


     A popular way to simplify this is by using the library axios.

     We provided an empty array as second argument to the useEffect hook to avoid activating it on component updates. This way, it only fetches on component mount.',

There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,

     ## 1. Syntax:

     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.

     The syntax for class component looks like as below.


     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.

     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.


     ## 2. State:

     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.

     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.

     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**


     You didn''t use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.

     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.

     Let''s see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,


     ## 3. Props:

     Props are referred to as "properties". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.

     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,

StrictMode renders components twice in development mode(not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about those problems. This is used to detect accidental side effects in the render phase. If you used `create-react-app` development tool then it automatically enables StrictMode by default.


     If you want to disable this behavior then you can simply remove `strict` mode.


     To detect side effects the following functions are invoked twice:

     1. Function component bodies, excluding the code inside event handlers.
     2. Functions passed to `useState`, `useMemo`, or `useReducer` (any other Hook)
     3. Class component''s `constructor`, `render`, and `shouldComponentUpdate` methods

The `onClickCapture` React event is helpful to catch all the events of child elements irrespective of event propagation logic or even if the events propagation stopped. This is useful if you need to log every click events for analytics purpose.

     For example, the below code triggers the click event of parent first followed by second level child eventhough leaf child button elements stops the propagation.

React updates UI in three steps,

     1. **Triggering or initiating a render:** The component is going to triggered for render in two ways.

        1. **Initial render:** When the app starts, you can trigger the initial render by calling `creatRoot` with the target DOM node followed by invoking component''s `render` method. For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.


        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen''t state automatically queues for a render.

     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.

     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders.',

React prevents component from re-rendering for each and every state update by grouping multiple state updates within an event handler. This strategy improves the application performance and this process known as **batching**. The older version of React only supported batching for browser events whereas React18 supported for asynchronous actions, timeouts and intervals along with native events. This improved version of batching is called **automatic batching**.

      Let''s demonstrate this automatic batching feature with a below example.

Yes, it is possible to prevent automatic batching default behavior. There might be cases where you need to re-render your component after each state update or updating one state depends on another state variable.

This hydration acts as a bridge to reduce the gap between server side and client-side rendering.

      After the page loaded with generated static HTML, React will add application state and interactivity by attaching all event handlers for the respective elements. Let''s demonstrate this with an example.

Eventhough JavaScript objects are mutable, you need to treat objects inside state as read-only while updating the state.

      Let''s see this comparison with an example. The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.


      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won''t be update upon entering the input fields.
      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.


      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field. Now, UI displays the updated field values as expected without an issue.',

You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn''t work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let''s demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.


      If you try to update the country nested field in a regular javascript fashion(as shown below) then user profile screen won''t be updated with latest value.


      This issue can be fixed by flattening all the fields into a top-level object or create a new object for each nested object and point it to it''s parent object. In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the address object should be linked to parent user object something like below.

Eventhough arrays in JavaScript are mutable in nature, you need to treat them as immutable while storing them in a state. That means, similar to objects, the arrays cannot be updated directly inside state. Instead, you need to create a copy of the existing array and then set the state to use newly copied array.

      To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assignment(arr[1]=''one''), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.

      For example, the below push operation doesn''t add the new todo to the total todo''s list in an event handler.

Immer library enforces the immutability of state based on **copy-on-write** mechanism. It uses JavaScript proxy to keep track of updates to immutable states. Immer has 3 main states as below,

      1. **Current state:** It refers to actual state
      2. **Draft state:** All new changes will be applied to this state. In this state, draft is just a proxy of the current state.
      3. **Next state:** It is formed after all mutations applied to the draft state

      Immer can be used by following below instructions,

      1. Install the dependency using `npm install use-immer` command
      2. Replace `useState` hook with `useImmer` hook by importing at the top
      3. The setter function of `useImmer` hook can be used to update the state.

      'How does ReactJS work behind the scenes?',
      'ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here''s an overview of how it works internally:

     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**

     React doesn''t manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.

     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):

        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).
        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.
        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.
        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.

     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.

     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**

     React’s core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:

        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).
        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).
        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.

     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:

        *   The component type (function/class).
        *   Props, state, and effects.
        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.

     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**

     When state or props change:

        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.
        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.
        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.

     This process is known as **reconciliation**.

     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**

     Once reconciliation is done:

        *   React enters the **commit phase**.
        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.
        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.

     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.

     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**

     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):

        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.
        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.
        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.

     #### 6. **React Scheduler**

     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:

        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.
        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.
        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode.',

     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.

     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**

     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):

        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.
        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.
        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.

     #### 6. **React Scheduler**

     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:

        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.
        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.
        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode.',

The `useContext` hook is a built-in React Hook that lets you access the value of a context inside a functional component without needing to wrap it in a <Context.Consumer> component.

     It helps you **avoid prop drilling** (passing props through multiple levels) by allowing components to access shared data like themes, authentication status, or user preferences.

     The usage of useContext involves three main steps:
      #### **Step 1 : Create the Context**
    
        Use `React.createContext()` to create a context object.
    
    
      You typically export this so other components can import it.

      #### **Step 2: Provide the Context Value**
    
        Wrap your component tree (or a part of it) with the `Context.Provider` and pass a `value` prop.
    
    
        Now any component inside `<ThemeContext.Provider>` can access the context value.

        #### **Step 3: Consume the Context with** `**useContext**`
    
        In any functional component **inside the Provider**, use the `useContext` hook:',

The `useMemo()` Hook in React is used to **optimize performance** by **memoizing the result of expensive calculations**. It ensures that a function is **only re-executed when its dependencies change**, preventing unnecessary computations on every re-render.

     #### Syntax

      - **`computeExpensiveValue`**:  
      A function that returns the computed result.

     - **`dependencies`**:  
      An array of values that, when changed, will cause the memoized function to re-run.

      If the dependencies haven’t changed since the last render, React returns the **cached result** instead of re-running the function.

      Let''s exaplain the usage of `useMemo` hook with an example of user search and its respective filtered users list.

      #### Example: Memoizing a Filtered List

      In the above example:
        - The filteredUsers list is only recomputed when searchTerm changes.
        - Pressing the "Increment Counter" button does not trigger the filtering logic again, as it''s not a dependency.
        - The console will only log "Filtering users..." when the search term updates.',

An **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.
     
     The updater function expression looks like below,
     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.

     In the React community, there''s often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or "stale" state.

     While using an updater function is a good habit, it''s not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.
     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.

     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**

     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.

     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:',

     While using an updater function is a good habit, it''s not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don’t run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.
     However, if you’re doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.

     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**

     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.

     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don’t need the updater function:',

The `useState` hook is synchronous, but state updates are asynchronous. When you call `useState()`, it runs synchronously and returns the state variable and setter function as tuple.
     This happens immediately during rendering.
     However, the state update function (**setState**) is asynchronous in the sense that it doesn''t update the state immediately.
     React **batches** updates and applies them before the next render. You won’t see the updated value immediately after calling `setState`.
     
     **Example:**
     The > `console.log(count)` prints the **old value**, because the update hasn’t happened yet.
     
     To see the updated state value, you can use `useEffect()` hook. It runs **after the component has re-rendered.**  By the time `useEffect` runs:

React’s hooks, including `useState`, rely on some internal machinery that keeps track of state **per component** and **per hook call** during rendering. Here''s a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:

      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**

      *   React maintains a linked list or array of "hook states" for each component.
      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.
      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one "slot" in this list.

      #### 2. **State Storage**

      *   Each slot stores:
        *   The current state value.
        *   A queue of pending state updates.

      #### 3. **Initial Render**
        
      *   When the component first renders, React:
         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).
         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.

      #### 4. **Updater Function**
    
      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:
        *   Enqueues a state update to React''s internal queue.
        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.
    
      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**
    
      *   On the next render:
        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.
        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.
        *   Returns the new state to the component.

      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**

      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.
      *   That’s why you can’t call hooks conditionally.

     *   State updates depend on the **previous state** and **logic**.

Yes, it is possible. You can use multiple contexts inside the same component by calling useContext multiple times, once for each context.

A **common pitfall** when using `useContext` with objects is **triggering unnecessary re-renders** across all consuming components — even when only part of the context value changes.

     When you provide an object as the context value, React compares the entire object reference. If the object changes (even slightly), React assumes the whole context has changed, and **all components using** `useContext(MyContext)` **will re-render**, regardless of whether they use the part that changed.

     **Example:**
     In this case, a change in `theme` will also trigger a re-render in components that only care about `user`.

     This issue can be fixed in two ways,

     **1. Split Contexts**  
     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:


     **2. Memoize Context Value**  
     Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:

The `useLayoutEffect` can **cause layout thrashing** when you **repeatedly read and write to the DOM** in ways that force the browser to recalculate layout multiple times per frame. This is because `useLayoutEffect` runs _before the browser paints_, these reflows happen _synchronously_, blocking rendering and degrading performance.

      **Example:**
      In the above code, each read/write cycle triggers synchronous reflows, blocking the main thread and delays UI rendering.

**Custom Hooks** in React are JavaScript functions that allow you to **extract and reuse component logic** using React’s built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

      They start with the word **"use"** and let you encapsulate logic that multiple components might share—such as fetching data, handling forms, or managing timers—without repeating code.

      Let''s explain the custom hook usage with `useFetchData` example. The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.


      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.

      **Example: AuthorList component**
     
      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:
       *   Promotes **code reuse**
       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**
       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**',

      'How does React Fiber works? Explain in detail.',
      'React Fiber is the **core engine** that enables advanced features like **concurrent rendering**, **prioritization**, and **interruptibility** in React. Here''s how it works:
          
      ### 1. **Fiber Tree Structure**
          
      Each component in your app is represented by a **Fiber node** in a tree structure. A Fiber node contains:
      *   Component type
      *   Props & state
      *   Pointers to parent, child, and sibling nodes
      *   Effect tags to track changes (e.g., update, placement)
      *   This forms the **Fiber Tree**, a data structure React uses instead of the traditional call stack.
          
      ### 2. **Two Phases of Rendering**
          
        #### **A. Render Phase (work-in-progress)**
          
      *   React builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**.
      *   It walks through each component (begin phase), calculates what needs to change, and collects side effects (complete phase).
      *   This phase is **interruptible**—React can pause it and resume later.
        #### **B. Commit Phase**
          
      *   React applies changes to the **Real DOM**.
      *   Runs lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`).
      *   This phase is **non-interruptible** but fast.
          
        ### 3. **Work Units and Scheduling**
          
      *   React breaks rendering into **units of work** (small tasks).
      *   These units are scheduled based on **priority** using the **React Scheduler**.
      *   If time runs out (e.g., user starts typing), React can **pause and yield** control back to the browser.
          
        ### 4. **Double Buffering with Two Trees**
          
      *   React maintains two trees:
      *   **Current Tree** – what''s visible on the screen.
      *   **Work-In-Progress Tree** – the next version being built in memory.
      *   Only after the new tree is fully ready, React **commits** it, making it the new current tree.
          
        ### 5. **Concurrency and Prioritization**
          
      *   React can prepare multiple versions of UI at once (e.g., during slow data loading).
      *   Updates can be **assigned priorities**, so urgent updates (like clicks) are handled faster than background work.',

The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.

    #### Example


    #### When to use the callback?

    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.

    #### Note

    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.
    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.
    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change.',

Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.

    #### Example


    #### When to use the callback?

    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.

    #### Note

    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.
    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.
    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change.',

There are 3 possible ways to achieve this in class components:

   1. **Binding in Constructor:** In JavaScript classes, the methods are not bound by default. The same rule applies for React event handlers defined as class methods. Normally we bind them in constructor.


   2. **Public class fields syntax:** If you don''t like to use bind approach then _public class fields syntax_ can be used to correctly bind callbacks. The Create React App enables this syntax by default.



   3. **Arrow functions in callbacks:** It is possible to use _arrow functions_ directly in the callbacks.

There are two approaches

   1. This is a recently added approach. _Refs_ are created using `React.createRef()` method and attached to React elements via the `ref` attribute. In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.


   2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component''s input element is accessed as follows,

If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={''textInput''}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.

   1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.
   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can''t put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.
   3. They _don''t work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can''t guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.
   4. It doesn''t work as most people would expect with the "render callback" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)',

    - **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:** Executed right before rendered output is committed to the DOM. Any value returned by this will be passed into `componentDidUpdate()`. This is useful to capture information from the DOM i.e. scroll position.
    - **componentDidUpdate:** Mostly it is used to update the DOM in response to prop or state changes. This will not fire if `shouldComponentUpdate()` returns `false`.
    - **componentWillUnmount** It will be used to cancel any outgoing network requests, or remove all event listeners associated with the component.',

    this.setState((prevState, props) =&gt; ({
      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,
    }));</code></pre>

The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can''t be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.

    Let''s say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.


    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.


    **(OR)**

    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?

    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

    This counter example will fail to update as expected:


    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.',

The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.


    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.

    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting.',

Starting from react-scripts@3.3.0+ releases onwards, you can now optionally start a new app from a template by appending `--template [template-name]` to the creation command. If you don''t select a template, it will create your project with base template. Remember that templates are always named in the format `cra-template-[template-name]`, here you only need to fill the `[template-name]` section.

        The typeScript can be used in your project by appending `--template typescript` to the creation command.


        But if you are using React Scripting between react-scripts@2.1.0 and react-scripts@3.2.x , there is a built-in support for TypeScript. i.e, `create-react-app` now supports TypeScript natively. You can just pass `--typescript` option as below


         Whereas for lower versions of react scripts, just supply `--scripts-version` option as `react-scripts-ts` while you create a new project. `react-scripts-ts` is a set of adjustments to take the standard `create-react-app` project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.

Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.

    React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen.

Higher-order components come with a few caveats apart from its benefits. Below are the few listed in an order,

    1.  **Don’t use HOCs inside the render method:**
        It is not recommended to apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component.


        The above code impacts on performance by remounting a component that causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.

    2.  **Static methods must be copied over:**
        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component


        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,


    3.  **Refs aren’t passed through:**
        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API',

`State mutation` happens when you try to update the state of a component without actually using `setState` function. This can happen when you are trying to do some computations using a state variable and unknowingly save the result in the same state variable. This is the main reason why it is advised to return new instances of state variables from the reducers by using Object.assign({}, ...) or spread syntax.

    This can cause unknown issues in the UI as the value of the state variable got updated without telling React to check what all components were being affected from this update and it can cause UI bugs.

    Ex:


    **How to prevent it:** Make sure your state variables are immutable by either enforcing immutability by using plugins like Immutable.js, always using `setState` to make updates, and returning new instances in reducers when sending updated state values.',
