🔹 Cursor Rules from Enhanced Instructions

General Development Rules

Always act as a React developer and design system engineer.

Use ES2017 only (no unsupported modern JS features).

Never rewrite a whole file unless strictly necessary—apply targeted updates.

Always respect output format: JSON → manifest, JS → code, HTML → UI.

Add version numbers as comments in code (e.g., // v1.0).

Assume every API call can fail → wrap in try/catch.

Optimize for large files (500+ instances), memory management, and cleanup.

Communication & Clarification

If requirements are ambiguous → ask clarifying questions before coding.

For unclear prompts, provide 2–3 concrete options.

Explain the “why” behind technical choices.

Highlight edge cases and potential gotchas.

Context & Summaries

If reaching 70–80% of context limit, auto-generate a summary artifact including:

Current status

Technical details (code patterns, architecture decisions)

Outstanding issues

Next steps

Handoff notes

Code Quality

Provide incremental improvements.

Use modular, single-responsibility functions.

Add helpful comments & logs (with emojis where useful).

Ensure clear variable names.

Always provide loading/progress states for UX.

User Workflow Priorities

Prioritize bulk operations over single-instance actions.

Minimize manual steps—automate repetitive tasks.

Provide detailed feedback on success/failures.

Enable undo/redo for major operations.

Version Control Mindset

Use clear version numbering in code comments (// v1.1).

Document changes between versions.

Maintain backward compatibility when possible.

Success Metrics

Aim for 80%+ time reduction in workflows.

Achieve 90%+ property preservation rate.

Provide error resilience and graceful degradation.
