    "explanation": "Refs will not get passed through because ref is not a prop. It is handled differently by React just like **key**. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. In this case, you can use Forward Ref API. For example, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API.\n\n    The below HOC logs all props,\n\n\n    Let's use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our \"fancy button\" component,\n\n\n    Now let's create a ref and pass it to FancyButton component. In this case, you can set focus to button element.",

Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once.\n\n    2.  **Static methods must be copied over:**\n        When you apply a HOC to a component the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component\n\n\n        You can overcome this by copying the methods onto the container before returning it,\n\n\n    3.  **Refs aren't passed through:**\n        For HOCs you need to pass through all props to the wrapped component but this does not work for refs. This is because ref is not really a prop similar to key. In this case you need to use the React.forwardRef API",
