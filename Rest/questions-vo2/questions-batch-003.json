    "content": "<pre><code>e    // Correct\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => ({\n      counter: prevState.counter + props.increment,\n    }));</code></pre>\n\nThe reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n\n    **(OR)**\n\n    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?\n\n    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n    This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n\n    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object.

But at the same it is recommended to avoid async initialization in `componentWillMount()` lifecycle method. `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. It is called before `render()`, therefore setting state in this method will not trigger a re-render. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. We need to make sure async calls for component initialization happened in `componentDidMount()` instead of `componentWillMount()`.",

In order to use _refs_ throughout the component, just assign the _ref_ to the instance property within constructor.\n\n\n   2. You can also use ref callbacks approach regardless of React version. For example, the search bar component's input element is accessed as follows,\n\n   You can also use _refs_ in function components using **closures**.\n   **Note**: You can also use inline ref callbacks even though it is not a recommended approach.",

This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM.

Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n   4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)",

This is because `useLayoutEffect` runs _before the browser paints_, these reflows happen _synchronously_, blocking rendering and degrading performance.\n\n      **Example:**\n      In the above code, each read/write cycle triggers synchronous reflows, blocking the main thread and delays UI rendering.\n\n      This issue can be avoided by batching your DOM reads and writes and prevent unnecessary reads after writes.",
