    "explanation": "The primary use case for `isMounted()` is to avoid calling `setState()` after a component has been unmounted, because it will emit a warning.\n\n\n    Checking `isMounted()` before calling `setState()` does eliminate the warning, but it also defeats the purpose of the warning. Using `isMounted()` is a code smell because the only reason you would check is because you think you might be holding a reference after the component has unmounted.\n\n    An optimal solution would be to find places where `setState()` might be called after a component has unmounted, and fix them. Such situations most commonly occur due to callbacks, when a component is waiting for some data and gets unmounted before the data arrives. Ideally, any callbacks should be canceled in `componentWillUnmount()`, prior to unmounting.",

    "type": "code",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "The reason behind for this is that `setState()` is an asynchronous operation. React batches state changes for performance reasons, so the state may not change immediately after `setState()` is called. That means you should not rely on the current state when calling `setState()` since you can't be sure what that state will be. The solution is to pass a function to `setState()`, with the previous state as an argument. By doing this you can avoid issues with the user getting the old state value on access due to the asynchronous nature of `setState()`.\n\n    Let's say the initial count value is zero. After three consecutive increment operations, the value is going to be incremented only by one.\n\n\n    If we pass a function to `setState()`, the count gets incremented correctly.\n\n\n    **(OR)**\n\n    ### Why function is preferred over object for `setState()`?\n\n    React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance. Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.\n\n    This counter example will fail to update as expected:\n\n\n    The preferred approach is to call `setState()` with function rather than object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument.",

    "explanation": "If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the `ref` attribute is a string, like `ref={'textInput'}`, and the DOM node is accessed as `this.refs.textInput`. We advise against it because _string refs have below issues_, and are considered legacy. String refs were **removed in React v16**.\n\n   1. They _force React to keep track of currently executing component_. This is problematic because it makes react module stateful, and thus causes weird errors when react module is duplicated in the bundle.\n   2. They are _not composable_ — if a library puts a ref on the passed child, the user can't put another ref on it. Callback refs are perfectly composable.\n   3. They _don't work with static analysis_ like Flow. Flow can't guess the magic that framework does to make the string ref appear on `this.refs`, as well as its type (which could be different). Callback refs are friendlier to static analysis.\n   4. It doesn't work as most people would expect with the \"render callback\" pattern (e.g. <DataGrid renderRow={this.renderRow} />)",

    "content": "What are the different phases of component lifecycle?",
    "type": "multiple-choice",

    "explanation": "The component lifecycle has three distinct lifecycle phases:\n\n    1. **Mounting:** The component is ready to mount in the browser DOM. This phase covers initialization from `constructor()`, `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `render()`, and `componentDidMount()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    2. **Updating:** In this phase, the component gets updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state either from `setState()` or `forceUpdate()`. This phase covers `getDerivedStateFromProps()`, `shouldComponentUpdate()`, `render()`, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` and `componentDidUpdate()` lifecycle methods.\n\n    3. **Unmounting:** In this last phase, the component is not needed and gets unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase includes `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method.\n\n    It's worth mentioning that React internally has a concept of phases when applying changes to the DOM. They are separated as follows\n\n    4. **Render** The component will render without any side effects. This applies to Pure components and in this phase, React can pause, abort, or restart the render.\n\n    5. **Pre-commit** Before the component actually applies the changes to the DOM, there is a moment that allows React to read from the DOM through the `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`.\n\n    6. **Commit** React works with the DOM and executes the final lifecycles respectively `componentDidMount()` for mounting, `componentDidUpdate()` for updating, and `componentWillUnmount()` for unmounting.\n\n    React 16.3+ Phases (or an [interactive version](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/))\n\n    ![phases 16.4+](images/phases16.4.png)\n\n    Before React 16.3\n\n    ![phases 16.2](images/phases.png)",

The `useFetchData` custom Hook is a reusable function in React that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API. It encapsulates common logic such as initiating the fetch request, managing loading and error states, and storing the fetched data. By using built-in Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`, `useFetchData` provides a clean interface that returns the `data`, `loading`, and `error` values, which can be directly used in components.\n\n\n      The above custom hook can be used to retrieve users data for `AuthorList`, `ReviewerList` components.\n\n      **Example: AuthorList component**\n     \n      Some of the benefits of custom hooks are:\n       *   Promotes **code reuse**\n       *   Keeps components **clean and focused**\n       *   Makes complex logic **easier to test and maintain**",

    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "React Fiber is the **core engine** that enables advanced features like **concurrent rendering**, **prioritization**, and **interruptibility** in React. Here's how it works:\n          \n      ### 1. **Fiber Tree Structure**\n          \n      Each component in your app is represented by a **Fiber node** in a tree structure. A Fiber node contains:\n      *   Component type\n      *   Props & state\n      *   Pointers to parent, child, and sibling nodes\n      *   Effect tags to track changes (e.g., update, placement)\n      *   This forms the **Fiber Tree**, a data structure React uses instead of the traditional call stack.\n          \n      ### 2. **Two Phases of Rendering**\n          \n        #### **A. Render Phase (work-in-progress)**\n          \n      *   React builds a **work-in-progress Fiber tree**.\n      *   It walks through each component (begin phase), calculates what needs to change, and collects side effects (complete phase).\n      *   This phase is **interruptible**—React can pause it and resume later.\n        #### **B. Commit Phase**\n          \n      *   React applies changes to the **Real DOM**.\n      *   Runs lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `useEffect`).\n      *   This phase is **non-interruptible** but fast.\n          \n        ### 3. **Work Units and Scheduling**\n          \n      *   React breaks rendering into **units of work** (small tasks).\n      *   These units are scheduled based on **priority** using the **React Scheduler**.\n      *   If time runs out (e.g., user starts typing), React can **pause and yield** control back to the browser.\n          \n        ### 4. **Double Buffering with Two Trees**\n          \n      *   React maintains two trees:\n      *   **Current Tree** – what's visible on the screen.\n      *   **Work-In-Progress Tree** – the next version being built in memory.\n      *   Only after the new tree is fully ready, React **commits** it, making it the new current tree.\n          \n        ### 5. **Concurrency and Prioritization**\n          \n      *   React can prepare multiple versions of UI at once (e.g., during slow data loading).\n      *   Updates can be **assigned priorities**, so urgent updates (like clicks) are handled faster than background work.",

    "explanation": "The `useMemo` hook **does not directly prevent re-rendering of child components**. Its main purpose is to memoize the result of an expensive computation so that it doesn't get recalculated unless its dependencies change. While this can improve performance, it doesn't inherently control whether a child component re-renders.\n        \n        However, `useMemo` **can help prevent re-renders** when the memoized value is passed as a prop to a child component that is wrapped in `React.memo`. In that case, if the memoized value doesn't change between renders (i.e., it has the same reference), React.memo can skip re-rendering the child. So, while `useMemo` doesn't stop renders on its own, it **works in combination** with tools like `React.memo` to optimize rendering behavior.",

    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "The callback function provided as the second argument to `setState` is executed after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered. Because `setState()` is asynchronous, you cannot reliably perform actions that require the updated state immediately after calling `setState`. The callback ensures your code runs only after the update and re-render are complete.\n\n    #### Example\n\n\n    #### When to use the callback?\n\n    Use the `setState` callback when you need to perform an action immediately after the DOM has been updated in response to a state change. i.e, The callback is a reliable way to perform actions after a state update and re-render, especially when the timing is critical due to the asynchronous nature of state updates in React. For example, if you need to interact with the updated DOM, trigger analytics, or perform further computations that depend on the new state or rendered output.\n\n    #### Note\n\n    - In modern React (with function components), you can achieve similar effects using the `useEffect` hook to respond to state changes.\n    - In class components, you can also use lifecycle methods like `componentDidUpdate` for broader post-update logic.\n    - The `setState` callback is still useful for one-off actions that directly follow a specific state change.",
