These include:\n\n     1.  **Immutability is essential**  \n        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux's more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.\n     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  \n        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.\n     3.  **Limited static type integration**  \n        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux's type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.",

This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.\n     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  \n        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.\n     3.  **Limited static type integration**  \n        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux's type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.",
