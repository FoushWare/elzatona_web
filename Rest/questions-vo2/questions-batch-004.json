Here's a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:\n\n      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**\n\n      *   React maintains a linked list or array of \"hook states\" for each component.\n      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.\n      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one \"slot\" in this list.\n\n      #### 2. **State Storage**\n\n      *   Each slot stores:\n        *   The current state value.\n        *   A queue of pending state updates.\n\n      #### 3. **Initial Render**\n        \n      *   When the component first renders, React:\n         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).\n         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.\n\n      #### 4. **Updater Function**\n    \n      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:\n        *   Enqueues a state update to React's internal queue.\n        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.\n    \n      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**\n    \n      *   On the next render:\n        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.\n        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.\n        *   Returns the new state to the component.\n\n      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**\n\n      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.\n      *   That's why you can't call hooks conditionally.\n      \n      The pseudocode for internal implementation of `useState` looks like below,",

    "content": "The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:\n\n        1.  **Theme Customization**  \n            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.\n        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  \n            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.\n        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  \n            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.\n        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  \n            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.\n        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  \n            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.\n             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,",

    "explanation": "The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:\n\n        1.  **Theme Customization**  \n            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.\n        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  \n            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.\n        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  \n            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.\n        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  \n            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.\n        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  \n            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.\n             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,",

Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.\n\n     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):\n\n        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).\n        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.\n        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.\n        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.\n\n     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.\n\n     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**\n\n     React's core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16.

    "content": "useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library.

This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\n     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect.",

The main differences are listed down as below,\n\n     ## 1. Syntax:\n\n     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.\n\n     The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n\n\n     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.\n\n     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.\n\n\n     ## 2. State:\n\n     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.\n\n     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n\n     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**\n\n\n     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.\n\n     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.\n\n     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,\n\n\n     ## 3. Props:\n\n     Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.\n\n     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,\n\n\n     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.",
