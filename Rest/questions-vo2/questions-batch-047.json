The router module will take care history by wrapping routes with `<BrowserRouter` component.\n     3. The application size is reduced by adding only the specific router module(Web, core, or native)",

    "explanation": "It is up to the developer's decision, i.e., it is developer's job to determine what kinds of state make up your application, and where each piece of state should live. Some users prefer to keep every single piece of data in Redux, to maintain a fully serializable and controlled version of their application at all times. Others prefer to keep non-critical or UI state, such as \"is this dropdown currently open\", inside a component's internal state.\n\n     Below are the rules of thumb to determine what kind of data should be put into Redux\n\n     1. Do other parts of the application care about this data?\n     2. Do you need to be able to create further derived data based on this original data?\n     3. Is the same data being used to drive multiple components?\n     4. Is there value to you in being able to restore this state to a given point in time (ie, time travel debugging)?\n     5. Do you want to cache the data (i.e, use what's in state if it's already there instead of re-requesting it)?",

This will ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders and it preserves the state of Hooks between multiple re-renders due to `useState` and `useEffect` calls.\n\n     Let's see the difference using an example,\n     **Correct usage:**:\n     **Incorrect usage:**:\n     The `useState` hook for the country field is being called conditionally within an `if` block. This can lead to inconsistent state behavior and may cause hooks to be called in a different order on each re-render.\n\n     2. **Call Hooks from React Functions only:** You shouldn't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions or class components. Instead, you should call them from either function components or custom hooks.\n\n     Let's find the difference of correct and incorrect usage with below examples,\n\n     **Correct usage:**:\n     **Incorrect usage:**:\n     In the above incorrect usage example, both `useState` and `useEffect` are used in non-React functions(`normalFunction` and `fetchData`), which is not allowed.",
