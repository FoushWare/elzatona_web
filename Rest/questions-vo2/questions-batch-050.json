    "explanation": "React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.\n\n    1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript\n        In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:\n      \n        If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.\n\n    2. JSX Is JavaScript\n    \n        When you write JSX like this:\n        It will be compiled to:\n        But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.\n        which compiles to:\n        React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.\n\n    3. Aligns with DOM APIs\n        In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:\n        React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API's property name rather than HTML's attribute.",

    "explanation": "The **Uncontrolled components** are form elements (like `<input`, `<textarea`, or `<select`) that **manage their own state internally** via the **DOM**, rather than through React state.\n    You can query the DOM using a `ref` to find its current value when you need it. This is a bit more like traditional HTML.\n\n    The uncontrolled components will be implemented using the below steps,\n\n    1. Create a ref using `useRef` react hook in function component or `React.createRef()` in class based component.\n    2. Attach this `ref` to the form element.\n    3. The form element value can be accessed directly through `ref` in event handlers or `componentDidMount` for class components\n\n    In the below UserProfile component, the `username` input is accessed using ref.\n\n    **Note:** Here, DOM is in charge of the value. React only accesses the value when needed (via `ref`).\n\n    **Benefits:**\n     *   **Less boilerplate** — no need for `useState` and `onChange`.\n     *   Useful for **quick form setups** or when integrating with **non-React code**.\n     *   Slightly better **performance** in very large forms (fewer re-renders).\n\n    In most cases, it's recommend to use controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.\n\n    <p\n\n\n    </p",

    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "A _higher-order component_ (_HOC_) is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component with additional props, behavior, or data. It's a design pattern based on React's compositional nature, allowing you to reuse logic across multiple components without modifying their internals.\n\n    We consider HOCs **pure components** because they don't mutate or copy behavior from the original component—they simply **wrap it**, enhance it, and pass through the necessary props. The wrapped component remains decoupled and reusable.\n\n    Let's take an example of a `withAuth` higher-order component (HOC) in React. This HOC will check if a user is authenticated and either render the wrapped component if authenticated or redirect (or show a message) if not.\n\n    **withAuth HOC Example:**\n    **Usage**\n\n    HOC can be used for many use cases:\n\n    1. Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction (e.g., fetching data, permissions, theming).\n    2. Render hijacking (e.g., conditional rendering or layout changes).\n    3. State abstraction and manipulation(e.g., handling form logic).\n    4. Props manipulation(e.g., injecting additional props or filtering them).\n    \n    Some of the real-world examples of HOCs in react eco-system:\n    1. connect() from react-redux\n    2. withRouter() from React Router v5\n    3. withTranslation() from react-i18next\n    4. withApollo() from Apollo client\n    5. withFormik from Formik library\n    6. withTheme from styled components",

    "explanation": "A **controlled component** is a React component that **fully manages the form element's state**(e.g, elements like `<input`, `<textarea`, or `<select`))  using React's internal state mechanism. i.e, The component does not manage its own internal state — instead, React acts as the single source of truth for form data.\n\n    The controlled components will be implemented using the below steps,\n\n    1. Initialize the state using `useState` hooks in function components or inside constructor for class components.\n    2. Set the value of the form element to the respective state variable.\n    3. Create an event handler(`onChange`) to handle the user input changes through `useState`'s updater function or `setState` from class component.\n    4. Attach the above event handler to form element's change or click events\n\n    **Note:** React re-renders the component every time the input value changes.\n\n   For example, the name input field updates the username using `handleChange` event handler as below,\n\n   In these components, DOM does not hold the actual data instead React does.\n   \n   **Benefits:**\n\n   *   Easy to implement **validation**, **conditional formatting**, or **live feedback**.\n   *   Full control over form data.\n   *   Easier to test and debug because the data is centralized in the component's state.",

    "explanation": "`Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the `real DOM` and the copy of DOM `(Virtual DOM)` when there's an update of components.\n    React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.\n    Now React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called _Reconciliation_.",

    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:\n\n    ### State\n    - **Definition:**  \n      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).\n    - **Scope:**  \n      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.\n    - **Usage:**  \n      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.\n    - **Re-rendering:**  \n      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.\n\n    ### Props\n    - **Definition:**  \n      Props (short for \"properties\") are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      Props are read-only. A component cannot modify its own props; they are immutable from the component's perspective.\n    - **Scope:**  \n      Props are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree, enabling parent components to configure or communicate with their children.\n    - **Usage:**  \n      Props are commonly used to make components reusable and configurable. They allow the same component to be rendered with different data or behavior.\n    - **Analogy:**  \n      Think of props as arguments to a function, whereas state is like variables declared inside the function.\n\n    ### Summary Table\n\n    | Feature   | State                               | Props                             |\n    |-----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n    | Managed by| The component itself                | Parent component                  |\n    | Mutable   | Yes                                 | No (read-only)                    |\n    | Scope     | Local to the component              | Passed from parent to child       |\n    | Usage     | Manage dynamic data and UI changes  | Configure and customize component |\n    | Update    | Using setState/useState             | Cannot be updated by the component|",

    "content": "How Virtual DOM works?",
    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "The _Virtual DOM_ works in five simple steps.\n\n    **1. Initial Render**  \n        When a UI component renders for the first time, it returns JSX. React uses this structure to create a Virtual DOM tree, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This Virtual DOM is then used to build and render the Real DOM in the browser.\n\n    **2. State or Props Change**  \n        When the component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM reflecting the updated UI. However, it doesn't immediately update the Real DOM; instead, it works in memory to prepare for an efficient update.\n               \n      ![vdom](images/vdom1.png)\n\n    **3. Diffing Algorithm**  \n        React then compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called diffing. It determines what has changed between the two versions and identifies the minimal set of updates needed.\n       \n       ![vdom2](images/vdom2.png)  \n\n    **4. Reconciliation**  \n        Based on the diffing results, React decides which parts of the Real DOM should be updated. It avoids re-rendering the entire DOM and instead updates only the elements that actually changed.\n        \n       ![vdom3](images/vdom3.png)\n\n    **5. Efficient DOM Updates**  \n        This entire process—working with the Virtual DOM, diffing, and selective updating—makes the UI rendering much faster and more efficient than manipulating the Real DOM directly.",

    "explanation": "A `key` is a special attribute you **should** include when mapping over arrays to render data. _Key_ prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.\n\n    Keys should be unique among its siblings. Most often we use ID from our data as _key_:\n\n\n    When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item _index_ as a _key_ as a last resort:\n\n    **Benefits of key:**\n      *   Enables React to **efficiently update and re-render** components.\n      *   Prevents unnecessary re-renders by **reusing** components when possible.\n      *   Helps **maintain internal state** of list items correctly.\n\n    **Note:**\n\n    1. Using _indexes_ for _keys_ is **not recommended** if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.\n    2. If you extract list item as separate component then apply _keys_ on list component instead of `li` tag.\n    3. There will be a warning message in the console if the `key` prop is not present on list items.\n    4. The key attribute accepts either string or number and internally convert it as string type.\n    5. Don't generate the key on the fly something like `key={Math.random()}`.

In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`\n       Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name.

    "explanation": "React offers a powerful set of features that have made it one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces:\n\n    **Core Features:**\n\n    - **Component-Based Architecture**: React applications are built using components - independent, reusable pieces of code that return HTML via a render function. This modular approach enables better code organization, reusability, and maintenance.\n\n    - **Virtual DOM**: React creates an in-memory data structure cache, computes the resulting differences, and efficiently updates only the changed parts in the browser DOM. This approach significantly improves performance compared to direct DOM manipulation.\n\n    - **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript. JSX makes the code more readable and expressive while providing the full power of JavaScript.\n\n    - **Unidirectional Data Flow**: React follows a one-way data binding model where data flows from parent to child components. This makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n    - **Declarative UI**: React allows you to describe what your UI should look like for a given state, and it handles the DOM updates when the underlying data changes.\n\n    **Advanced Features:**\n\n    - **React Hooks**: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow using state and other React features in functional components without writing classes.\n\n    - **Context API**: Provides a way to share values between components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.\n\n    - **Error Boundaries**: Components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display fallback UI instead of crashing.\n\n    - **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Enables rendering React components on the server before sending HTML to the client, improving performance and SEO.\n\n    - **Concurrent Mode**: A set of new features (in development) that help React apps stay responsive and gracefully adjust to the user's device capabilities and network speed.\n\n    - **React Server Components**: A new feature that allows components to be rendered entirely on the server, reducing bundle size and improving performance.\n\n    - **Suspense**: A feature that lets your components \"wait\" for something before rendering, supporting code-splitting and data fetching with cleaner code.\n\n    These features collectively make React powerful for building everything from small widgets to complex, large-scale web applications.",

    "explanation": "After the addition of Hooks(i.e. React 16.8 onwards) it is always recommended to use Function components over Class components in React. Because you could use state, lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component present in function component too.\n\n    But even there are two reasons to use Class components over Function components.\n\n    1. If you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.\n    2. In older versions, If the component needs _state or lifecycle methods_ then you need to use class component.\n\n    So the summary to this question is as follows:\n\n    **Use Function Components:**\n\n    - If you don't need state or lifecycle methods, and your component is purely presentational.\n    - For simplicity, readability, and modern code practices, especially with the use of React Hooks for state and side effects.\n\n    **Use Class Components:**\n\n    - If you need to manage state or use lifecycle methods.\n    - In scenarios where backward compatibility or integration with older code is necessary.\n\n    **Note:** You can also use reusable [react error boundary](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-error-boundary) third-party component without writing any class. i.e, No need to use class components for Error boundaries.\n\n    The usage of Error boundaries from the above library is quite straight forward. **_Note when using react-error-boundary:_** ErrorBoundary is a client component. You can only pass props to it that are serializable or use it in files that have a `\"use client\";` directive.",

    "explanation": "The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.\n\n       The main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.\n\n       But there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.\n\n           The evolution of React has a fascinating history that spans over a decade:\n    \n       **2010-2011: The Origins**\n       - The journey began with **XHP**, a PHP extension created at Facebook that allowed HTML components to be used in PHP code\n       - XHP improved front-end code readability and helped prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks\n       - However, XHP had limitations with dynamic web applications, requiring frequent server roundtrips and complete UI re-renders for small changes\n\n       **2011-2012: Early Development**\n       - Jordan Walke created the first prototype called **FaxJS** (later renamed to React), inspired by XHP's component model\n       - The key innovation was bringing XHP's component model to JavaScript with performance improvements\n       - React introduced the Virtual DOM concept to solve the performance issues of full page re-renders\n       - First deployed internally on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and Instagram in 2012\n\n       **2013: Public Release**\n       - React was officially open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013\n       - Initial public reception was mixed, with some developers skeptical about the JSX syntax and the approach of mixing markup with JavaScript\n\n       **2014-2015: Growing Adoption**\n       - React Native was announced in 2015, extending React's paradigm to mobile app development\n       - The ecosystem began to grow with tools like Redux for state management\n       - Companies beyond Facebook began adopting React for production applications\n\n       **2016-2018: Maturation**\n       - React 16 (\"Fiber\") was released in 2017 with a complete rewrite of the core architecture\n       - Introduction of new features like Error Boundaries, Portals, and improved server-side rendering\n       - React 16.3 introduced the Context API for easier state management\n\n       **2019-Present: Modern React**\n       - React Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 (February 2019), revolutionizing state management in functional components\n       - React 17 (October 2020) focused on making React upgrades easier\n       - React 18 (March 2022) introduced concurrent rendering and automatic batching\n       - React continues to evolve with Server Components, the new React compiler (React Forget), and other performance improvements\n\n       **Note:** JSX, React's syntax extension, was indeed inspired by XHP's approach of embedding XML-like syntax in code.",

    "explanation": "Pure components are the components which render the same output for the same state and props. In function components, you can achieve these pure components through memoized `React.memo()` API wrapping around the component. This API prevents unnecessary re-renders by comparing the previous props and new props using shallow comparison. So it will be helpful for performance optimizations.\n\n    But at the same time, it won't compare the previous state with the current state because function component itself prevents the unnecessary rendering by default when you set the same state again.\n\n    The syntactic representation of memoized components looks like below,\n\n\n    Below is the example of how child component(i.e., EmployeeProfile) prevents re-renders for the same props passed by parent component(i.e.,EmployeeRegForm).\n\n\n    In the above code, the email prop has not been passed to child component. So there won't be any re-renders for email prop change.\n\n    In class components, the components extending _`React.PureComponent`_ instead of _`React.Component`_ become the pure components. When props or state changes, _PureComponent_ will do a shallow comparison on both props and state by invoking `shouldComponentUpdate()` lifecycle method.\n\n    **Note:** `React.memo()` is a higher-order component.",

    "explanation": "**Element:**\n      - A React **Element** is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to see on the UI. It represents a DOM node or a component at a specific point in time. \n      - Elements are immutable: once created, you cannot change their properties. Instead, you create new elements to reflect updates.\n      - Elements can be nested within other elements through their `props`.\n      - Creating an element is a fast, lightweight operation—it does **not** create any actual DOM nodes or render anything to the screen directly.\n\n        **Example (without JSX):**\n\n        **Equivalent JSX syntax:**\n\n        **The object returned by `React.createElement`:**\n        Elements are then passed to the React DOM renderer (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`), which translates them to actual DOM nodes.\n\n\n      **Component:**\n      - A **Component** is a function or class that returns an element (or a tree of elements) to describe part of the UI. Components can accept inputs (called **props**) and manage their own state (in case of class or function components with hooks).\n      - Components allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, each isolated and composable.\n      - You can define a component using a function or a class:\n\n        **Example (Function Component with JSX):**\n\n        When JSX is compiled, it's transformed into a tree of `React.createElement` calls:\n\n\n\n      **In summary:**\n      - **Elements** are the smallest building blocks in React—objects that describe what you want to see.\n      - **Components** are functions or classes that return elements and encapsulate logic, structure, and behavior for parts of your UI. Think of **elements** as the instructions for creating UI, and **components** as reusable blueprints that combine logic and structure to generate those instructions.",

The splice method does modify the original array, which means that the fruit array now consists of `['🍊', '🍎']`.\nAt last, we invoke the `unshift` method on the `fruit` array, which modifies the original array by adding the provided value, '🍇' in this case,  as the first element in the array.
