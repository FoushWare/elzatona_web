If the object changes (even slightly), React assumes the whole context has changed, and **all components using** `useContext(MyContext)` **will re-render**, regardless of whether they use the part that changed.\n\n     **Example:**\n     In this case, a change in `theme` will also trigger a re-render in components that only care about `user`.\n\n     This issue can be fixed in two ways,\n\n     **1. Split Contexts**  \n     Create separate contexts for unrelated pieces of state:\n\n\n     **2. Memoize Context Value**  \n     Use `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders:\n\n\n     However, this only helps if the object structure and dependencies are well controlled.",

    "explanation": "React's hooks, including `useState`, rely on some internal machinery that keeps track of state **per component** and **per hook call** during rendering. Here's a simplified explanation of the internal mechanics:\n\n      #### 1. **Hook List / Linked List**\n\n      *   React maintains a linked list or array of \"hook states\" for each component.\n      *   When a component renders, React keeps track of which hook it is currently processing via a cursor/index.\n      *   Each call to `useState()` corresponds to one \"slot\" in this list.\n\n      #### 2. **State Storage**\n\n      *   Each slot stores:\n        *   The current state value.\n        *   A queue of pending state updates.\n\n      #### 3. **Initial Render**\n        \n      *   When the component first renders, React:\n         *   Creates a new slot for `useState` with the initial state (e.g., `0`).\n         *   Returns `[state, updaterFunction]`.\n\n      #### 4. **Updater Function**\n    \n      *   The updater function (`setCount`) is a closure that, when called:\n        *   Enqueues a state update to React's internal queue.\n        *   Schedules a re-render of the component.\n    \n      #### 5. **Re-render and State Update**\n    \n      *   On the next render:\n        *   React processes all queued updates for each hook slot.\n        *   Updates the stored state value accordingly.\n        *   Returns the new state to the component.\n\n      #### 6. **Important: Hook Order**\n\n      *   Hooks must be called in the same order on every render so React can match hook calls to their internal slots.\n      *   That's why you can't call hooks conditionally.\n      \n      The pseudocode for internal implementation of `useState` looks like below,",

    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "An **updater function** is a form of `setState` where you pass a **function** instead of a direct value. This function receives the **previous state** as an argument and returns the **next state**.\n     \n     The updater function expression looks like below,\n     Here, `prevCount => prevCount + 1` is the updater function.\n\n     In the React community, there's often a recommendation to use updater functions when updating state that depends on its previous value. This helps prevent unexpected behaviors that can arise from working with outdated or \"stale\" state.\n\n     While using an updater function is a good habit, it's not always necessary. In most cases, React batches updates and ensures that the state is up-to-date at the beginning of the event handler, so you typically don't run into stale state issues during a single synchronous event.\n     However, if you're doing multiple updates to the same state variable within a single handler, using the updater form ensures that each update correctly uses the latest state value, rather than a potentially outdated one.\n\n     **Example: Multiple Updates in One Handler**\n\n     In this example, `a => a + 1` is an **updater function**. React queues these updater functions and applies them sequentially, each using the most recent state value. As a result, the counter will correctly increment by 3.\n\n     In many cases, such as setting state based on user input or assigning static values, you don't need the updater function:",

    "explanation": "There are two guidelines to be taken care while writing reducers in your code.\n\n     1. Reducers must be pure without mutating the state. That means, same input always returns the same output. These reducers run during rendering time similar to state updater functions. So these functions should not send any requests, schedule time outs and any other side effects.\n\n     2. Each action should describe a single user interaction even though there are multiple changes applied to data. For example, if you \"reset\" registration form which has many user input fields managed by a reducer, it is suggested to send one \"reset\" action instead of creating separate action for each fields. The proper ordering of actions should reflect the user interactions in the browser and it helps a lot for debugging purpose.",

    "content": "How does ReactJS work behind the scenes?",
    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. While it appears simple on the surface, React performs a lot of complex operations behind the scenes to efficiently update the UI. Here's an overview of how it works internally:\n\n     #### **1. Virtual DOM & Component Rendering**\n\n     React doesn't manipulate the real DOM directly. Instead, it uses a **Virtual DOM** — a lightweight JavaScript representation of the UI.\n\n     When a component renders (e.g., `<App />`):\n\n        *   React **executes the component function** (e.g., `App()`).\n        *   Hooks like `useState` are registered and tracked in order.\n        *   React builds a **Virtual DOM tree** from the returned JSX.\n        *   This virtual DOM is a **plain JS object** that describes the desired UI.\n\n     This process ensures fast and efficient rendering before React decides how to update the real DOM.\n\n     #### 2. **React Fiber Architecture**\n\n     React's core engine is called **Fiber**, introduced in React 16. Fiber is a reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm with the following capabilities:\n\n        *   Breaks rendering work into **units of work** (fiber nodes).\n        *   Enables **interruptible rendering** (important for responsiveness).\n        *   Supports **priority scheduling** and **concurrent rendering**.\n\n     Each Fiber node represents a component and stores:\n\n        *   The component type (function/class).\n        *   Props, state, and effects.\n        *   Links to parent, child, and sibling fibers.\n\n     #### 3. **Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)**\n\n     When state or props change:\n\n        *   React re-executes the component to produce a new virtual DOM.\n        *   It **compares the new virtual DOM to the previous one** using an efficient diffing algorithm.\n        *   React determines the **minimal set of DOM changes** required.\n\n     This process is known as **reconciliation**.\n\n     #### 4. **Commit Phase (Real DOM Updates)**\n\n     Once reconciliation is done:\n\n        *   React enters the **commit phase**.\n        *   It applies calculated changes to the **real DOM**.\n        *   It also runs side effects like `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.\n\n     This is the only time React interacts directly with the browser DOM.\n\n     #### 5. **Hooks and State Management**\n\n     With Hooks (like `useState`, `useEffect`):\n\n        *   React keeps an **internal list of hooks per component**.\n        *   Hooks are identified by their order in the function.\n        *   When state updates occur, React re-renders the component and re-runs the hooks in the same order.\n\n     #### 6. **React Scheduler**\n\n     React uses an internal **Scheduler** to control how updates are prioritized:\n\n        *   Urgent tasks like clicks and inputs are processed immediately.\n        *   Non-urgent tasks (like data fetching) can be delayed or paused.\n        *   This improves responsiveness and allows for **time slicing** in Concurrent Mode.",

    "explanation": "The `useContext` hook in React is used to share data across components without having to pass props manually through each level. Here are some common and effective use cases:\n\n        1.  **Theme Customization**  \n            `useContext` can be used to manage application-wide themes, such as light and dark modes, ensuring consistent styling and enabling user-driven customization.\n        2.  **Localization and Internationalization**  \n            It supports localization by providing translated strings or locale-specific content to components, adapting the application for users in different regions.\n        3.  **User Authentication and Session Management**  \n            `useContext` allows global access to authentication status and user data. This enables conditional rendering of components and helps manage protected routes or user-specific UI elements.\n        4.  **Shared Modal or Sidebar Visibility**  \n            It's ideal for managing the visibility of shared UI components like modals, drawers, or sidebars, especially when their state needs to be controlled from various parts of the app.\n        5.  **Combining with** `**useReducer**` **for Global State Management**  \n            When combined with `useReducer`, `useContext` becomes a powerful tool for managing more complex global state logic. This pattern helps maintain cleaner, scalable state logic without introducing external libraries like Redux.\n             Some of the common use cases of useContext are listed below,",

    "explanation": "Eventhough arrays in JavaScript are mutable in nature, you need to treat them as immutable while storing them in a state. That means, similar to objects, the arrays cannot be updated directly inside state. Instead, you need to create a copy of the existing array and then set the state to use newly copied array.\n\n      To ensure that arrays are not mutated, the mutation operations like direct direct assignment(arr[1]='one'), push, pop, shift, unshift, splice etc methods should be avoided on original array. Instead, you can create a copy of existing array with help of array operations such as filter, map, slice, spread syntax etc.\n\n      For example, the below push operation doesn't add the new todo to the total todo's list in an event handler.\n\n\n      This issue is fixed by replacing push operation with spread syntax where it will create a new array and the UI updated with new todo.",

    "explanation": "You cannot simply use spread syntax for all kinds of objects inside state. Because spread syntax is shallow and it copies properties for one level deep only. If the object has nested object structure, UI doesn't work as expected with regular JavaScript nested property mutation. Let's demonstrate this behavior with an example of User object which has address nested object inside of it.\n\n\n      If you try to update the country nested field in a regular javascript fashion(as shown below) then user profile screen won't be updated with latest value.\n\n\n      This issue can be fixed by flattening all the fields into a top-level object or create a new object for each nested object and point it to it's parent object. In this example, first you need to create copy of address object and update it with the latest value. Later, the address object should be linked to parent user object something like below.\n\n\n      This approach is bit verbose and not easy for deep hierarchical state updates.

Let's demonstrate this with an example.\n\n      Consider that React DOM API(using `renderToString`) generated HTML for `<App` component which contains `<button` element to increment the counter.\n\n\n      The above code generates the below HTML with a header text and button component without any interactivity.\n\n\n      At this stage `hydrateRoot` API can be used to perform hydration by attaching `onClick` event handler.\n\n\n      After this step, you are able to run React application on server-side and hydrating the javascript bundle on client-side for smooth user experience and SEO purposes.",

Considering this situation, React introduced `flushSync` method from `react-dom` API for the usecases where you need to flush state updates to DOM immediately.\n\n      The usage of `flushSync` method within an `onClick` event handler will be looking like as below,\n\n\n      In the above click handler, React will update DOM at first using flushSync and second time updates DOM because of the counter setter function by avoiding automatic batching.",

    "explanation": "You cannot update the objects which exists in the state directly. Instead, you should create a fresh new object (or copy from the existing object) and update the latest state using the newly created object. Eventhough JavaScript objects are mutable, you need to treat objects inside state as read-only while updating the state.\n\n      Let's see this comparison with an example. The issue with regular object mutation approach can be described by updating the user details fields of `Profile` component. The properties of `Profile` component such as firstName, lastName and age details mutated in an event handler as shown below.\n\n\n      Once you run the application with above user profile component, you can observe that user profile details won't be update upon entering the input fields.\n      This issue can be fixed by creating a new copy of object which includes existing properties through spread syntax(...obj) and add changed values in a single event handler itself as shown below.\n\n\n      The above event handler is concise instead of maintaining separate event handler for each field. Now, UI displays the updated field values as expected without an issue.",

For example, the following code snippet renders `App` component on root DOM node.\n\n\n        2. **Re-render when the state updated:** When you update the component state using the state setter function, the componen't state automatically queues for a render.\n\n     2. **Rendering components:** After triggering a render, React will call your components to display them on the screen. React will call the root component for initial render and call the function component whose state update triggered the render. This is a recursive process for all nested components of the target component.\n\n     3. **Commit changes to DOM:** After calling components, React will modify the DOM for initial render using `appendChild()` DOM API and apply minimal necessary DOM updates for re-renders based on differences between rerenders.",

    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "useEffect and useLayoutEffect are both React hooks that can be used to synchronize a component with an external system, such as a browser API or a third-party library. However, there are some key differences between the two:\n\n     - Timing: useEffect runs after the browser has finished painting, while useLayoutEffect runs synchronously before the browser paints. This means that useLayoutEffect can be used to measure and update layout in a way that feels more synchronous to the user.\n\n     - Browser Paint: useEffect allows browser to paint the changes before running the effect, hence it may cause some visual flicker. useLayoutEffect synchronously runs the effect before browser paints and hence it will avoid visual flicker.\n\n     - Execution Order: The order in which multiple useEffect hooks are executed is determined by React and may not be predictable. However, the order in which multiple useLayoutEffect hooks are executed is determined by the order in which they were called.\n\n     - Error handling: useEffect has a built-in mechanism for handling errors that occur during the execution of the effect, so that it does not crash the entire application. useLayoutEffect does not have this mechanism, and errors that occur during the execution of the effect will crash the entire application.\n\n     In general, it's recommended to use useEffect as much as possible, because it is more performant and less prone to errors. useLayoutEffect should only be used when you need to measure or update layout, and you can't achieve the same result using useEffect.",

    "explanation": "There are two different ways to create components in ReactJS. The main differences are listed down as below,\n\n     ## 1. Syntax:\n\n     The class components uses ES6 classes to create the components. It uses `render` function to display the HTML content in the webpage.\n\n     The syntax for class component looks like as below.\n\n\n     **Note:** The **Pascal Case** is the recommended approach to provide naming to a component.\n\n     Functional component has been improved over the years with some added features like Hooks. Here is a syntax for functional component.\n\n\n     ## 2. State:\n\n     State contains information or data about a component which may change over time.\n\n     In class component, you can update the state when a user interacts with it or server updates the data using the `setState()` method. The initial state is going to be assigned in the `Constructor()` method using the `this.state` object and it is possible to assign different data types such as string, boolean, numbers, etc.\n\n     **A simple example showing how we use the setState() and constructor():**\n\n\n     You didn't use state in functional components because it was only supported in class components. But over the years hooks have been implemented in functional components which enables to use state too.\n\n     The `useState()` hook can used to implement state in functional components. It returns an array with two items: the first item is current state and the next one is a function (setState) that updates the value of the current state.\n\n     Let's see an example to demonstrate the state in functional components,\n\n\n     ## 3. Props:\n\n     Props are referred to as \"properties\". The props are passed into React component just like arguments passed to a function. In other words, they are similar to HTML attributes.\n\n     The props are accessible in child class component using `this.props` as shown in below example,\n\n\n     Props in functional components are similar to that of the class components but the difference is the absence of 'this' keyword.",

    "explanation": "A wrapper in React is a component that wraps or surrounds another component or group of components. It can be used for a variety of purposes such as adding additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped components.\n\n     For example, consider a simple component that displays a message:\n\n\n     We can create a wrapper component that will add a border to the message component:\n\n\n     Now we can use the MessageWrapper component instead of the Message component and the message will be displayed with a border:\n\n\n     Wrapper component can also accept its own props and pass them down to the wrapped component, for example, we can create a wrapper component that will add a title to the message component:\n\n\n     Now we can use the MessageWrapperWithTitle component and pass title props:\n\n\n     This way, the wrapper component can add additional functionality, styling, or layout to the wrapped component while keeping the wrapped component simple and reusable.",

    "explanation": "The preexisting variables outside of the function scope including state, props and context leads to a mutation and they result in unpredictable bugs during the rendering stage. The below points should be taken care while working with arrays variables.\n\n      1. You need to take copy of the original array and perform array operations on it for the rendering purpose. This is called local mutation.\n      2. Avoid triggering mutation methods such as push, pop, sort and reverse methods on original array. It is safe to use filter, map and slice method because they create a new array.",
