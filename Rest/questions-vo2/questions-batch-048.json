    "content": "What are the downsides of Redux compared to Flux?",
    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "difficulty": "intermediate",
    "explanation": "While Redux offers a powerful and predictable state management solution, it comes with a few trade-offs when compared to Flux. These include:\n\n     1.  **Immutability is essential**  \n        Redux enforces a strict immutability model for state updates, which differs from Flux's more relaxed approach. This means you must avoid mutating state directly. Many Redux-related libraries assume immutability, so your team must be disciplined in writing pure update logic. You can use tools like `redux-immutable-state-invariant`, `Immer`, or `Immutable.js` to help enforce this practice, especially during development.\n     2.  **Careful selection of complementary packages**  \n        Redux is more minimal by design and provides extension points such as middleware and store enhancers. This has led to a large ecosystem, but it also means you must thoughtfully choose and configure additional packages for features like undo/redo, persistence, or form handling—something Flux explicitly leaves out but may be simpler to manage in smaller setups.\n     3.  **Limited static type integration**  \n        While Flux has mature support for static type checking with tools like Flow, Redux's type integration is less seamless. Although TypeScript is commonly used with Redux now, early Flow support was limited, and more boilerplate was required for static type safety. This may affect teams that rely heavily on type systems for large codebases.",

This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.\n     3. **Changes are made with pure functions(Reducers):** To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.",

    "explanation": "**Flux** is an **application architecture** (not a framework or library) designed by Facebook to manage **data flow** in React applications. It was created as an alternative to the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, and it emphasizes a **unidirectional data flow** to make state changes more predictable and easier to debug.\n\n       Flux complements React by organizing the way data moves through your application, especially in large-scale or complex projects.\n\n       #### Core Concepts of Flux\n\n       Flux operates using **four key components**, each with a specific responsibility:\n       *   **Actions**\n             *   Plain JavaScript objects or functions that describe _what happened_ (e.g., user interactions or API responses).\n             *   Example: `{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: 'Buy milk' }`\n       *   **Dispatcher**\n             *   A central hub that receives actions and **dispatches** them to the appropriate stores.\n             *   There is **only one dispatcher** in a Flux application.\n       *   **Stores**\n             *   Hold the **application state** and business logic.\n             *   Respond to actions from the dispatcher and update themselves accordingly.\n             *   They **emit change events** that views can listen to.\n       *   **Views (React Components)**\n             *   Subscribe to stores and **re-render** when the data changes.\n             *   They can also trigger new actions (e.g., on user input).\n\n\n       The workflow between dispatcher, stores and views components with distinct inputs and outputs as follows:\n\n       ![flux](images/flux.png)",

It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. RxJS is a reactive programming library. It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. Think of it as an alternative to Promises. Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, Observables, to accomplish this pattern.",
