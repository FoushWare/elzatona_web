    "content": "In React, both **state** and **props** are plain JavaScript objects, but they serve different purposes and have distinct behaviors:\n\n    ### State\n    - **Definition:**  \n      State is a data structure that is managed within a component. It represents information that can change over the lifetime of the component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      State is mutable, meaning it can be changed using the setter function (`setState` in class components or the updater function from `useState` in functional components).\n    - **Scope:**  \n      State is local to the component where it is defined. Only that component can modify its own state.\n    - **Usage:**  \n      State is typically used for data that needs to change in response to user actions, network responses, or other dynamic events.\n    - **Re-rendering:**  \n      Updating the state triggers a re-render of the component and its descendants.\n\n    ### Props\n    - **Definition:**  \n      Props (short for \"properties\") are inputs to a component, provided by its parent component.\n    - **Mutability:**  \n      Props are read-only.
