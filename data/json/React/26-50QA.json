When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. This comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.\n\nNow React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM.

    "content": "React uses **className** instead of **class** because of a JavaScript naming conflict with the class keyword.\n1. `class` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript\n   In JavaScript, class is used to define ES6 classes:\n   ```js\n   class Person {\n     constructor(name) {\n       this.name = name;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   If you try to use class as a variable or property name, it will throw a syntax error. Since JSX is just JavaScript with XML-like syntax, using class directly in JSX would break the parser.\n2. JSX Is JavaScript\n   When you write JSX like this:\n   ```jsx\n   <div class=\"btn\">Click</div>\n   ```\n   It will be compiled to:\n   ```jsx\n   React.createElement('div', { class: 'btn' }, 'Click');\n   ```\n   But `class` is invalid in this object literal context (since it clashes with the JS keyword), hence React instead uses className.\n   ```jsx\n   <div className=\"btn\">Click</div>\n   ```\n   which compiles to:\n   ```jsx\n   React.createElement('div', { className: 'btn' }, 'Click');\n   ```\n   React then translates `className` to` class` in the final HTML DOM.\n3. Aligns with DOM APIs\n   In vanilla JavaScript, you interact with element classes using:\n   ```js\n   element.className = 'my-class';\n   ```\n   React follows this convention, staying consistent with the DOM API's property name rather than HTML’s attribute.",
