It's used for handling the view layer in web and mobile applications, and allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of those components efficiently.\n\nReact was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer at Facebook (now Meta). It was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. The library was open-sourced in May 2013 and has since become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building modern user interfaces.",

    "content": "The history of ReactJS started in 2010 with the creation of **XHP**. XHP is a PHP extension which improved the syntax of the language such that XML document fragments become valid PHP expressions and the primary purpose was used to create custom and reusable HTML elements.\n\nThe main principle of this extension was to make front-end code easier to understand and to help avoid cross-site scripting attacks. The project was successful to prevent the malicious content submitted by the scrubbing user.\n\nBut there was a different problem with XHP in which dynamic web applications require many roundtrips to the server, and XHP did not solve this problem. Also, the whole UI was re-rendered for small change in the application. Later, the initial prototype of React is created with the name **FaxJ** by Jordan inspired from XHP. Finally after sometime React has been introduced as a new library into JavaScript world.",

    "content": "Below are some of the main differences between HTML and React event handling,\n1. In HTML, the event name usually represents in _lowercase_ as a convention:\n   ```html\n   <button onclick=\"activateLasers()\"></button>\n   ```\n   Whereas in React it follows _camelCase_ convention:\n   ```jsx harmony\n   <button onClick={activateLasers}>\n   ```\n2. In HTML, you can return `false` to prevent default behavior:\n   ```html\n   <a\n     href=\"#\"\n     onclick='console.log(\"The link was clicked.\"); return false;'\n   />\n   ```\n   Whereas in React you must call `preventDefault()` explicitly:\n   ```javascript\n   function handleClick(event) {\n     event.preventDefault();\n     console.log(\"The link was clicked.\");\n   }\n   ```\n3. In HTML, you need to invoke the function by appending `()`\n   Whereas in react you should not append `()` with the function name.",
