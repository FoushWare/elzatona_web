    "content": "### PRPL Pattern\nThe **PRPL Pattern** is a web performance optimization strategy that focuses on making applications load and run efficiently, even on low-end devices or slow networks.\n\n**PRPL** stands for:\n- **P**: Push critical resources for the initial route.\n- **R**: Render the initial route as soon as possible.\n- **P**: Pre-cache assets for future routes.\n- **L**: Lazy-load remaining routes and assets.\n\nThis approach improves load times, offline experience, and caching efficiency.\n\n**Example:** Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that use an app shell, service workers, and code-splitting to load only what’s needed.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Faster first render.\n- Improved caching and offline usability.\n- Reduced bandwidth usage.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires careful bundling and caching strategy.\n- Over-pushing or preloading can waste bandwidth.",
