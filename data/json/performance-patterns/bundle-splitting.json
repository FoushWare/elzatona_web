    "content": "### Bundle Splitting\nBundle Splitting is a performance optimization technique that divides a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks. Instead of loading one huge file containing all code (even unused code), the application loads only what’s required for the current view.\n\n**Example:**\nSplitting `main.bundle.js` into `main.bundle.js` and `emoji-picker.bundle.js` reduces initial load time by fetching less data.\n\n**Why it matters:**\n- Reduces time to First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)\n- Decreases loading and execution time\n- Improves Time To Interactive (TTI)\n\n**Goal:** Deliver visible and interactive content to the user faster by minimizing unnecessary code loading.",
