Flashcard Add Triggers
1. Automatic Add on Failure

Whenever a user fails a question (e.g., in quizzes, practice tests, or flashcards themselves):

The system automatically saves the question & correct answer into their flashcard deck.

A toast/snackbar appears:
“This question has been added to your Flashcards for review later.”

(Optional) Let the user undo right away.

2. Manual Add (User Intent)

Next to every question (in lessons, quizzes, practice sets), show an “Add to Flashcards” icon.

User can click this anytime, regardless of whether they answered correctly or not.

The icon changes state once saved:

Default: ➕ (add)

After save: ✅ (saved)

Click again: ❌ (remove)

Data Model (Firebase Firestore)

Each flashcard document could look like:

{
  "question": "What is JSX?",
  "answer": "A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React.",
  "source": "React Basics Quiz",
  "status": "new",              // new | learning | mastered
  "addedBy": "manual",          // manual | failed
  "createdAt": "2025-09-06T00:00:00Z",
  "lastReviewed": null,
  "nextReview": null
}
