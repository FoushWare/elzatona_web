## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /admin/login` - Admin login
- `POST /admin/logout` - Admin logout
- `GET /admin/session` - Validate admin session

### Audio Management

- `POST /admin/audio/upload` - Upload audio file
- `DELETE /admin/audio/:id` - Delete audio file
- `GET /admin/audio/:id` - Get audio file info

### TTS

- `POST /api/tts/openai` - OpenAI TTS synthesis
- `POST /api/tts` - Browser TTS fallback

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Security**: All passwords are hashed using bcryptjs with 12 salt rounds
2. **Session Management**: JWT tokens with 24-hour expiry
3. **Access Control**: Role-based access (super_admin vs admin)
4. **File Upload Security**: File type and size validation
5. **Firebase Rules**: Currently open for development, will be secured for production

## Usage Instructions

### Initial Setup

1. Run the initialization script to create the super admin account
2. Access the admin login page at `/admin/login`
3. Login with the provided credentials
4. Access the dashboard at `/admin/dashboard`

### Audio Management

1. Select a learning path from the dropdown
2. Browse questions in the selected path
3. Upload audio files for questions and/or answers
4. Audio files will be automatically played on the questions page
5. TTS will be used as fallback if no custom audio is available

### Admin Management

1. View all admin accounts
2. Create new admin accounts
3. Deactivate existing admin accounts
4. Monitor admin activity

## Testing Checklist
