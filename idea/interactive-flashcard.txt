Interactive Flashcards Page

Purpose: Help learners reinforce weak areas by revisiting questions they previously struggled with.

Core Features

Flashcard Decks

Each card shows a question on the front.

Learner tries to recall the answer.

On click/flip, the correct answer is revealed.

Answer Feedback

After revealing, user selects:

✅ I was correct

❌ I was wrong

Adaptive Scheduling

If user answers wrong → card is scheduled to appear in the next session (or even at the end of the current one).

If user answers correctly → card is delayed using a spaced repetition interval (e.g., 1 day → 3 days → 7 days → etc.).

Session Mode

Learners get a set of flashcards based on:

Their previous mistakes.

New concepts added recently.

Progress Tracking

Dashboard showing:

Number of cards reviewed today.

Percentage correct vs incorrect.

Upcoming review schedule.

🔧 Implementation Suggestions (since your site is in React + Vercel):

Use a React flashcard component with flipping animation (Framer Motion can make it smooth).

Store progress (correct/incorrect, scheduling) in Firebase Firestore.

Use a queue-based system to serve cards dynamically per session.
