# 31 — Stats Section

## UI intent

Show summary counts (cards/plans/categories/topics/questions).

## Restore tasks

- [ ] Restore stats calculation and rendering.

## Refactor tasks

- [ ] Extract pure function: `computeContentStats(data)`.
- [ ] Keep section UI dumb; pass view model.

## TDD tasks

- [ ] Unit test `computeContentStats` with fixtures.

## Test suite tasks

- [ ] Component test: renders correct counts.

## Missing parts checklist

- [ ] Ensure counts match filtered or total? (confirm intended UX)
