    correctAnswer: "D",
    explanation: "Within the function, we first declare the name variable with the var keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of undefined, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the name variable, so it still holds the value of undefined. Variables with the let keyword (and const) are hoisted, but unlike var, don't get initialized. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the 'temporal dead zone'. When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError.",

    explanation: "Because of the event queue in JavaScript, the setTimeout callback function is called after the loop has been executed. Since the variable i in the first loop was declared using the var keyword, this value was global. During the loop, we incremented the value of i by 1 each time, using the unary operator ++. By the time the setTimeout callback function was invoked, i was equal to 3 in the first example. In the second loop, the variable i was declared using the let keyword: variables declared with the let (and const) keyword are block-scoped (a block is anything between { }).

      D: "NaN and 63"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    explanation: "Note that the value of diameter is a regular function, whereas the value of perimeter is an arrow function. With arrow functions, the this keyword refers to its current surrounding scope, unlike regular functions! This means that when we call perimeter, it doesn't refer to the shape object, but to its surrounding scope (window for example). Since there is no value radius in the scope of the arrow function, this.radius returns undefined which, when multiplied by 2 * Math.PI, results in NaN.",

    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. mouse[bird.size]: First it evaluates bird.size, which is 'small'. mouse['small'] returns true. However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. mouse does not have a key called bird, which means that mouse.bird is undefined. Then, we ask for the size using dot notation: mouse.bird.size. Since mouse.bird is undefined, we're actually asking undefined.size. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to Cannot read property 'size' of undefined.",

    explanation: "new Number() is a built-in function constructor. Although it looks like a number, it's not really a number: it has a bunch of extra features and is an object. When we use the == operator (Equality operator), it only checks whether it has the same value. They both have the value of 3, so it returns true. However, when we use the === operator (Strict equality operator), both value and type should be the same. It's not: new Number() is not a number, it's an object. Both return false.",

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "It logs the object, because we just created an empty object on the global object! When we mistyped greeting as greetign, the JS interpreter actually saw this as global.greetign = {} in Node.js, window.greetign = {}, frames.greetign = {} and self.greetign in browsers, self.greetign in web workers, globalThis.greetign in all environments.

    explanation: "In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method getFullName gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call Person.getFullName(), but member.getFullName throws a TypeError.

The base object has access to some methods and properties, such as .toString. This is the reason why you can use built-in JavaScript methods! All of such methods are available on the prototype.

    correctAnswer: "C",
    explanation: "JavaScript is a dynamically typed language: we don't specify what types certain variables are. Values can automatically be converted into another type without you knowing, which is called implicit type coercion. Coercion is converting from one type into another. In this example, JavaScript converts the number 1 into a string, in order for the function to make sense and return a value. During the addition of a numeric type (1) and a string type ('2'), the number is treated as a string. We can concatenate strings like 'Hello' + 'World', so what's happening here is '1' + '2' which returns '12'.",

    explanation: "React state updates are asynchronous and batched. When you call setCount multiple times in the same function, React batches these updates together.

    correctAnswer: "A",
    explanation: "In JavaScript, all object keys are strings (unless it's a Symbol). Even though we might not type them as strings, they are always converted into strings under the hood. JavaScript interprets (or unboxes) statements. When we use bracket notation, it sees the first opening bracket [ and keeps going until it finds the closing bracket ]. Only then, it will evaluate the statement. mouse[bird.size]: First it evaluates bird.size, which is 'small'. mouse['small'] returns true. However, with dot notation, this doesn't happen. mouse does not have a key called bird, which means that mouse.bird is undefined. Then, we ask for the size using dot notation: mouse.bird.size. Since mouse.bird is undefined, we're actually asking undefined.size. This isn't valid, and will throw an error similar to Cannot read property 'size' of undefined.",
